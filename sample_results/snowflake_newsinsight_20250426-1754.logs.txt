#ProBlue: How Wolverines in the NHL fared in 2024-25 - Part 2
Alex.Drain
April 25th, 2025 at 2:14 PM
Previously:
Part 1
We're back here for Part 2 of our series on how all the Wolverines in the NHL did this season. Last article we covered most of the established NHL players, while today we will cover the last remaining established NHLers, most of whom skew younger, before looking at guys who played a few NHL games this year but were mostly in the minors, one retiree, and then a quick rundown on past players now in the minor leagues for good/playing around the world.
The Younger Role Players
For all the people screaming WHAT ABOUT FRANK NAZAR? in the comments of the last piece, he will be in this section below. It's the same bucket as where I left off the previous piece but there were too many role players to put in that piece. So I broke it up, with the more established players in the previous piece and the younger ones here below. These are are players that haven't yet established themselves as top of the lineup guys but could be on the way (or are going to be career bottom of the lineup players):
Mackie Samoskevich, LW, Florida Panthers:
Samo had one of the best years relative to expectations of anyone in this year's update. He was placed onto the roster of the defending Stanley Cup Champions in part due to his inexpensive rookie contract and was asked to play down in the lineup, providing depth offense. There were bumps as you'd expect with a rookie but by mid-season he began to find his footing. After the Panthers suffered a slew of injuries to top players like Matthew Tkachuk, Samoskevich had positioned himself well to get a promotion and the chance to play with more skilled players.
From the start of February on, Samo saw his ice time tick way up to over 16 minutes per night and he provided Florida with eight goals and 15 points in 25 games, with decent metrics at both ends. Now that Florida is healthy to the playoffs, Samo slides back down to the bottom six/PP2 where his presence is a reason why the Panthers could repeat as the champs: when Mackie Samoskevich is your 9th or 10th best forward, you're cooking. I'm not sure Samoskevich is going to be a star in the NHL, but I saw enough this year to think Florida made another good draft decision in picking him and that he will carve out a nice career as a scoring line winger.
Frank Nazar, C, Chicago Blackhawks:
If you wanna talk about risers, or guys that exceeded expectations, let's talk about Frank Nazar. After spending the first half of the season in the AHL, Nazar got a mid-season call-up and dazzled over the second half of the year, with a particularly strong close. Chicago had a horrific team this year and the vibes were mostly terrible, but Nazar's presence helped brighte

2025-04-26 17:54:45,066 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: JPCERT warns of DslogdRAT malware deployed in Ivanti Connect Secure
Pierluigi Paganini
April 25, 2025
Researchers identified a new malware, named DslogdRAT, deployed after exploiting a now-patched flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS).
JPCERT/CC researchers reported that a new malware, dubbed DslogdRAT, and a web shell were deployed by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability during attacks on Japanese organizations in December 2024.
The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-0282
(CVSS score: 9.0), is a stack-based buffer overflow that impacts Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.5, Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways before version 22.7R2.3.
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the flaw to achieve remote code execution. A local authenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability to escalate privileges.
In January, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
the flaw
CVE-2025-0282
(CVSS score: 9.0) to its
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
.
In March 2025, Microsoft
warned
that China-backed APT
Silk Typhoon
linked to US Treasury hack, is now targeting global IT supply chains, using IT firms to spy and move laterally. The APT group exploited the zero-day in January 2025 attacks.
JPCERT/CC now states that attackers used a Perl-based CGI web shell that checked for a specific DSAUTOKEN cookie value and, if matched, executed arbitrary commands via the
system
function—likely used to run DslogdRAT malware.
“This Perl script is executed as a CGI and retrieves the Cookie header from incoming HTTP requests. If the value of
DSAUTOKEN=
matches
af95380019083db5
, the script uses the system function to execute an arbitrary command specified in the request parameter
data
.”reads the
report
published by JPCERT/CC. “It is considered that attackers accessed this simple web shell to execute commands to run malware such as DslogdRAT, which is discussed in the next section.”
DslogdRAT spawns two child processes: one stays idle in a loop, while the second handles core functions like C2 communication and command execution via the pthread library.
“Upon execution, the main process of DslogdRAT creates a first child process and then terminates itself. The child process then decodes the configuration data and creates a second child process.” continues the report. “The first child process enters a loop routine including sleep intervals, and thus it never gets terminated. The second child process contains DslogdRAT core functionality, which includes the following:
Create a worker thread and pass socket information for communication”
Initiate communication with the C2 server based on configuration data
DslogdRAT’s configuration is XOR-encoded and hardcoded, the researchers noticed that it is set to operate only from 8 AM to 8 PM to blend in with normal business activity and evade detection.
DslogdRAT uses socket connections with simple XOR encoding for C2 communication. In its initial exchan

The car rides on an adjustable air suspension along with a narrowed front axle beam, dropped spindles, lowered rear spring plates, disc brakes, and 17″ BRM-style wheels wrapped in Nankang tires. Finished in silver and white over white vinyl and gray tweed upholstery, the car is powered by a 2,110cc air-cooled flat-four equipped with dual 40mm EMPI HPMX carburetors, a PerTronix Flame-Thrower distributor, a serpentine belt conversion, and a Vintage Speed exhaust system with J-tubes. Additional details include a roof rack, a safari-style windshield, pop-out rear quarter windows, Porsche-style headlight lenses, HID headlamps, a bamboo parcel shelf, front lap belts, a roller accelerator pedal, a retro-style radio, and a Speedhut GPS speedometer. Acquired by the seller in 2020, this modified Beetle is now offered at no reserve with British Columbia registration.
The body was removed from the pan, repairs were performed, and replacement fenders were fitted before it was refinished in silver and white as part of the refurnishment in 2015. The rear bumper has been trimmed for clearance, and additional exterior details include a roof rack, a safari-style windshield, pop-out rear quarter windows, Porsche-style headlight lenses, HID headlamps, and Hella “snowflake” taillight lenses.
The 17″ BRM-style wheels are mounted with 205/40 Nankang Noble Sport NS-20 tires. The car has been fitted with four-wheel disc brakes, a narrowed front axle beam, drop spindles, and lowered rear spring plates in addition to an adjustable air suspension system linked with an air compressor mounted on the frame head plate, a tank beneath the rear seat, and switches below the dashboard.
Inside, the front bucket seats, rear bench, and door panels have been reupholstered in white vinyl with gray tweed inserts. Additional interior elements include a bamboo parcel shelf, front lap belts, a roller accelerator pedal, a retro-style radio, and EMPI door sill guards.
Instrumentation includes a 200-mph Speedhut GPS speedometer with an inset tachometer and a digital odometer that shows 436 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.
The 2,110cc air-cooled flat-four was built utilizing an (AE) AS41 dual relief engine case. Engine details include a counterweighted crankshaft, dual 40mm EMPI HPMX carburetors, a PerTronix Flame-Thrower distributor, a serpentine belt conversion, a degree pulley, a 12-volt alternator charging system, a Clyde Berg breather box, and a Vintage Speed exhaust system with J-tubes.
Power is sent to the rear wheels through a “Pro-Street” four-speed manual transaxle with a heavy-duty clutch.
Photos taken during the refurbishment and modification process are provided in the gallery.

2025-04-26 17:54:46,717 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: SAP NetWeaver zero-day allegedly exploited by an initial access broker
Pierluigi Paganini
April 25, 2025
A zero-day in SAP NetWeaver is potentially being exploited, putting thousands of internet-facing applications at risk.
Researchers warn that a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-31324
(CVSS score of 10/10), in SAP NetWeaver is potentially being exploited. Thousands of internet-facing applications are potentially at risk.
The flaw in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Metadata Uploader stems from a lack of proper authorization checks. This means that unauthenticated attackers, those without valid credentials, can exploit it to upload malicious executable files to the system.
Once uploaded, these files can be executed on the host system, potentially leading to a full compromise of the targeted SAP environment. SAP addressed the flaw with the release of the
April 2025 Security Patch Day
.
Researchers from ReliaQuest discovered the vulnerability while investigating multiple attacks, some of which led to the compromise of fully patched systems.
“On April 22, 2025, ReliaQuest published an investigation into exploitation activity targeting SAP NetWeaver systems, uncovering a critical vulnerability later identified by SAP as “CVE-2025-31324″ with a severity score of 10.” reads the
report
published by ReliaQuest. “Initially suspected as a remote file inclusion issue, it was confirmed to be an unrestricted file upload vulnerability, and SAP subsequently released a patch to address it, which we strongly recommend applying.”
The researchers pointed out that SAP systems are high-value targets for attackers due to their use by governments and enterprises. ReliaQuest reported the critical vulnerability to SAP, which led to a patch release. Before public disclosure, ReliaQuest deployed detection mechanisms and enhanced threat visibility to protect customers.
Attackers exploited the Metadata Uploader to upload malicious JSP webshells using crafted POST requests, then executed them with GET requests to gain full control of the target systems. All webshells were deployed in the same root directory, had similar capabilities, and reused code from a public GitHub RCE project.
“The vulnerability involved in these cases lies in the
/developmentserver/metadatauploader
endpoint, a feature designed to handle metadata files for application development and configuration in SAP applications within the NetWeaver environment. In theory, it’s supposed to streamline the transfer and processing of files like configuration data or serialized objects. But in the incidents we investigated, attackers found a way to exploit it.” continues the report. “Via carefully crafted POST requests, the attackers uploaded malicious JSP webshell files and wrote them to the
j2ee/cluster/apps/sap.com/irj/servletjsp/irj/root/
directory. Once there, these files could be executed remotely via simple GET requests, giving attackers full control and turning this endpoint into a launchpad for exploit

TCS is looking for people with skills in areas across My SQL DBA, Azure SME, IBM DB2, AWS SME, Oracle DBA, and DB2 Designer.
According to an internal email, the company is looking for experienced people who have done a minimum of 15 years of full-time education. They must not have a gap of more than two years between education and employment.
The latest hiring round comes just four weeks after a similar exercise by the software giant, which held walk-in interviews for tech workers in five cities on March 22.
In the last round, it hired people with three to six years of experience for diverse positions including Automation Tester (Selenium, Cucumber), Java Developers (Spring Boot and Microservices), Front End Angular Developers, Data Scientist (Python), Data Scientists (SAS/SQL), PowerBI Developer, Snowflake, and Lead web component developers (Angular) for positions in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Kolkata.

In January this year, TCS had reported a drop in its headcount by about 5,000 people due to attrition, and the company has been able to reverse this in a small measure in the January-March quarter.
The TCS hiring comes alongside software major
Infosys
pursuing a similar hiring exercise.
Infosys
had, last month, put out an internal mail saying it was looking for people across 40+ skill sets, including cloud computing, cyber security, Java Python, DotNet, Android/IoS development, and automation testing. The company was looking for people with a minimum of two years of experience.
Sources, however, said the upcoming recruitment was part of the company’s lateral hiring programme it conducts annually. Infosys had said earlier that it planned to hire 20,000 freshers next fiscal year, without disclosing a break-up between freshers and lateral hires. The Bengaluru-headquartered software giant has about 323,000 employees on its roster.

.
Self-styling itself as the Universal AI Platform company (did we miss Galactic AI somewhere in between?) the company’s AI Agents with Dataiku service is a set of capabilities designed to create and control AI agents and help pave the way towards AI applications powered by analytics, predictive models and agents.
Dataiku says it has witnessed rapid acceleration of generative AI and AI agent adoption over the past year with many companies integrating AI into their business and data workflows, with multiple projects per customer exceeding 1,000 active use cases.
As companies continue their rush to deploy agents,
many create clumsy architectures where agents operate without proper IT control, vary in quality and relevance.
They are sprawled ungoverned across teams

Leaders worldwide are promoting minimal AI regulation to drive innovation and avoid hindering growth. This strategy empowers businesses to explore new applications without excessive oversight. As AI capabilities evolve rapidly, organizations accelerate adoption to seize the technology’s transformative potential. Yet, this swift progress also brings escalating security challenges. Threat actors leverage AI to launch more sophisticated attacks, amplifying the need for vigilant defenses. As organizations race to harness AI’s potential, they must adopt proactive security measures and adaptive defense strategies to navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape.
The Dark Side Of Innovation: How AI Advancement Is Fueling A Surge In Cyber Threats
Global deregulation fuels rapid AI innovation, sparking an international arms race. Nations, from government-funded labs in China to tech giants in Silicon Valley, are racing to develop advanced AI capabilities to secure a strategic edge.
According to Delinea’s
Cybersecurity and the AI Threat Landscape report,
AI-powered threats surged in 2024. Tactics like AI-generated phishing and deepfake fraud bypassed traditional defenses, while info-stealer malware enabled large-scale breaches, as seen in the Snowflake incident. The growing reliance on machine identities expanded the attack surface, and poor credential rotation left systems exposed. This dual-use nature of AI highlights the delicate balance between progress and security.
The Emergence Of Shadow AI
In this fast-moving environment, organizations face an unintended consequence: shadow AI. This refers to the unsanctioned use of AI tools by teams without approval or oversight from IT or security departments. The easy availability of free or low-cost AI tools exacerbates the issue, allowing teams to bypass traditional procurement channels with built-in compliance controls.
These rogue AI projects address business needs without assessing risks, exposing sensitive data to breaches or compliance violations. Operating outside IT infrastructure, they evade security monitoring, increasing exploitation risk. For regulated industries like finance, healthcare or defense, shadow AI can lead to GDPR and HIPAA violations, resulting in fines, legal consequences and reputational damage.
Enhancing Organizational Resilience
The challenge of shadow AI is not merely technical but also an organizational and cultural issue. In many organizations, the rapid pace of innovation creates a "move fast and break things" mentality. While this can be beneficial in fostering creativity and agility, it also leads to environments whe

Pierluigi Paganini
April 25, 2025
The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group targeted at least six firms in South Korea in a cyber espionage campaign called Operation SyncHole.
Kaspersky researchers reported that the North Korea-linked APT group
Lazarus
targeted at least six firms in South Korea in a cyber espionage campaign tracked as Operation SyncHole.
The campaign has been active since at least November 2024, Lazarus Group is targeting South Korean organizations using
watering hole
tactics and exploiting software vulnerabilities. Targeted organizations are in IT, finance, semiconductors, and the telecom sectors, with likely more compromised.
Kaspersky notified
Korea Internet & Security Agency
(KrCERT/CC), the researchers discovered that threat actor exploited a one-day vulnerability in Innorix Agent for lateral movement.
The attackers used multiple hacking tools and malware, including
ThreatNeedle
, Agamemnon downloader,
wAgent
, SIGNBT, and
COPPERHEDGE
.
“The initial infection was discovered in November of last year when we detected a variant of the ThreatNeedle backdoor, one of the Lazarus group’s flagship malicious tools, used against a South Korean software company. We found that the malware was running in the memory of a legitimate SyncHost.exe process, and was created as a subprocess of Cross EX, legitimate software developed in South Korea.” reads the
report
published by Kaspersky. “This potentially was the starting point for the compromise of further five organizations in South Korea.”
In South Korea, many government and banking websites require users to install specific security software for functions like anti-keylogging and digital signatures. These programs run continuously in the background, making them attractive targets. The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group exploited vulnerabilities in one such program, Cross EX, using it in watering hole attacks aimed specifically at South Korean sectors. The malware injection process originated from Cross EX and was executed with high system privileges, suggesting privilege escalation. The National Cyber Security Center of South Korea had already issued advisories [

,

] on these risks in 2023, also collaborating with the UK on joint warnings. The incidents, all involving the same execution pattern and version of Cross EX, occurred between November 2024 and February 2025, confirming a coordinated and targeted campaign.
The Lazarus group exploited vulnerabilities in South Korean software, notably Innorix Agent and Cross EX, to infiltrate systems, spread malware, and streamline attacks. Infections began via compromised media sites, leading to ThreatNeedle malware deployment through malicious redirects and privilege escalation.
The Lazarus group’s Operation SyncHole is composed of two phases: initially using ThreatNeedle and wAgent malware, then shifting to SIGNBT and COPPERHEDGE. The researchers reported that after early detectio

Episode 221 –
Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI
–
We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display.
In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world.
Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves.
In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course.

Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down?
–
Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here?
In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software.

2025-04-26 17:54:51,984 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: Why NHIs Are Security's Most Dangerous Blind Spot

Apr 25, 2025

The Hacker News
Secrets Management / DevOps
When we talk about identity in cybersecurity, most people think of usernames, passwords, and the occasional MFA prompt. But lurking beneath the surface is a growing threat that does not involve human credentials at all, as we witness the exponential growth of Non-Human Identities (NHIs).
At the top of mind when NHIs are mentioned, most security teams immediately think of
Service Accounts
. But NHIs go far beyond that. You've got
Service Principals
,
Snowflake Roles
,
IAM Roles
, and platform-specific constructs from AWS, Azure, GCP, and more. The truth is, NHIs can vary just as widely as the services and environments in your modern tech stack, and managing them means understanding this diversity.
The real danger lies in how these identities authenticate.
Secrets: The Currency of Machines
Non-Human Identities, for the most part, authenticate using
secrets
: API keys, tokens, certificates, and other credentials that grant access to systems, data, and critical infrastructure. These secrets are what attackers want most. And shockingly, most companies have no idea how many secrets they have, where they're stored, or who is using them.
The
State of Secrets Sprawl 2025
revealed two jaw-dropping stats:
23.7 million
new secrets were leaked on public GitHub in 2024 alone
And
70%
of the secrets leaked in 2022 are
still valid today
Why is this happening?
A part of the story is that
there's no MFA for machines
. No verification prompt. When a developer creates a token, they often grant it wider access than needed, just to make sure things work.
Expiration dates? Optional. Some secrets are created with 50-year validity windows. Why? Because teams don't want the app to break next year. They choose speed over security.
This creates a massive blast radius. If one of those secrets leaks, it can unlock everything from production databases to cloud resources, without triggering any alerts.
Detecting compromised NHIs is much harder than with humans. A login from Tokyo at 2 am might raise red flags for a person, but machines talk to each other 24/7 from all over the world.
Malicious activity blends right in
.
Many of these secrets act like invisible backdoors, enabling lateral movement, supply chain attacks, and undetected breaches.
The Toyota incident
is a perfect example — one leaked secret can take down a global system.
This is why
attackers love NHIs and their secrets
. The permissions are too often high, the visibility is commonly low, and the consequences can be huge.
The Rise of the Machines (and Their Secrets)
The shift to cloud-native, microservices-heavy environments has introduced
thousands
of NHIs per organization. NHIs now outnumber human identities from
50:1 to a 100:1
ratio, and this is only expected to increase. These digital workers connect services, automate tasks, and drive AI pipelines — and every single one of them needs secrets to functi

The company holds a 37% share of the U.S. dialysis market and is headquartered in Denver, though incorporated in Delaware.
The company is ranked 341st on the Fortune 500.
On
April 18, 2025
, the company announced it is currently investigating and addressing a recent cybersecurity incident that has temporarily disrupted certain internal operations.
DaVita is prioritizing continuity of in-patient dialysis care following a cyberattack. They’ve activated contingency plans and manual procedures where necessary and are working to securely restore affected systems.
“On April 12, 2025, DaVita became aware of a ransomware incident affecting and encrypting certain on-premises systems. We activated our incident response protocols and implemented containment measures, including proactively disconnecting parts of the network.
External cybersecurity experts are assisting with our response, remediation and recovery efforts, and we are in the process of rebuilding and restoring encrypted systems and bringing them back online in a secure manner.”
states the company
. “While the incident has resulted in disruption to our internal operations, we continue to have contingency plans and manual processes in place where needed with a focus on continuity of patient care.”
The
Interlock ransomware
gang has claimed responsibility for the cyberattack on DaVita.

Samples
Getting started
Have your Snowflake account ready
If you don't have a Snowflake account yet, you can
sign up for a 30-day free trial account
.
Create a Python virtual environment
You can use
miniconda
,
anaconda
, or
virtualenv
to create a Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 virtual environment.
For Snowpark pandas, only Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 is supported.
To have the best experience when using it with UDFs,
creating a local conda environment with the Snowflake channel
is recommended.
Install the library to the Python virtual environment
pip
install
snowflake-snowpark-python
To use the
Snowpark pandas API
, you can optionally install the following, which installs
modin
in the same environment. The Snowpark pandas API provides a familiar interface for pandas users to query and process data directly in Snowflake.
pip
install
"snowflake-snowpark-python[modin]"

2025-04-26 17:54:56,640 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) data breach impacted 5.5 million patients
Pierluigi Paganini
April 24, 2025
Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) announced that threat actors stole the personal data of 5.5 million patients in a cyberattack.
Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) disclosed a data breach that exposed personal information of 5.5 million patients following a cyberattack that occurred earlier this month.
Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS) is a nonprofit healthcare network headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut. It stands as the largest healthcare system in the state, encompassing a comprehensive array of medical services and facilities.​
The system operates more than 360 locations across Connecticut, southeastern New York, and Rhode Island, managing over 2,400 beds and employing a vast network of healthcare professionals. The healthcare network employs about 30,000 health professionals and has an annual revenue of over $5.6 billion.
On March 11, 2025, YNHHS faced a cybersecurity incident affecting IT services. The issue was quickly contained with help from cybersecurity firm Mandiant. The company
declared
that patient care and medical records remain unaffected, though some internet and app access issues persist as part of recovery efforts. The organization also notified authorities.
YNHHS disclosed the data breach on April 11, 2025, it added that threat actors stole sensitive patient information. The stolen data varies by patient and includes the following info:
Full name
Date of birth
Home address
Telephone number
Email address
Race/ethnicity
Social Security number (SSN)
Patient type
Medical record number
It was clarified that the exposure did not include financial information, medical records, or treatment details.
“On March 8, 2025, we identified unusual activity affecting our Information Technology (IT) systems. We immediately took steps to contain the incident and began an investigation, which included assistance from external cybersecurity experts. We also reported the incident to law enforcement. The investigation determined that an unauthorized third-party gained access to our network and, on March 8, 2025, obtained copies of certain data.” reads the
Notice of Data Security Incident
published by the YNHHS. “At no point did this incident impact our ability to provide patient care.”
Starting April 14, YNHHS is mailing letters to patients affected by a data breach. While no misuse of data has been reported, free credit monitoring is offered to those whose Social Security numbers were involved. The organizations set up a dedicated call center at 1-855-549-2678 for questions.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services breach portal
, the incident impacted 5,556,702 individuals.
The organization did not disclose technical details about the attack, however, at this time, no ransomware group has taken responsibility for the attack.

The Three-Body Problem has been plaguing astronomers for 350 years. Predicting the orbital dynamics of two bodies is simple: You put a dot in the gravitational center between the two bodies, and draw circles based on their current masses and accelerations. Add a third body however and things get exponentially more complicated, introducing cascading levels of formulae as small factors interact with each other at non-repeatable angles.
This describes trying to project Elijah Dotson after he played his senior year with a generational prospect. Dotson was fairly unknown for much of the cycle, playing his first three seasons at historically strong but recently meh UofD Jesuit in Detroit—
the first two exclusively at receiver, the third at safety
with
plans to move him to cornerback
($)—before Dotson transferred to Belleville. The transfer brought him deep into the enormous gravity of Bryce Underwood, turning one of 2025's least scouted talents into one of its most late in the cycle. Scouts drawn to Belleville for Underwood (who hardly needed more scouting by that point) found Dotson a much more interesting evaluation. Michigan fans showing up to seal the deal were not shy about their desire for the rising #2 prospect in the state.
Calculating Dotson's trajectory thus requires going back to recreate the conditions when he committed to Pat Narduzzi and Archie Collins.
Clinkscale had built a relationship
, enough that Michigan had passed MSU (Dotson's favorite school growing up) and OSU (dad had deep Ohio connections after playing at BGSU). But Pitt came on strong just as Clink left for the NFL. Dotson was silently committed to Pitt by early 2024, and officially by late May. Michigan had Ivan Taylor, Kainoa Winston and Jordan Young on the hook.
Then came the transfer, a great 7v7 season, a move to safety, the first of several ratings bumps, and attempts by several schools to flip him. Dotson was trending to Michigan by November and committed a week before Underwood. At the time Young had just pledged to Clemson, and a lot of people assumed Dotson was the heroin-laced carrot to draw Bryce. A sense that Michigan didn't know what position they wante

2025 spring game
WTKA Roundtable 4/24/2025: Take Your Kid to Work Day
Seth
April 24th, 2025 at 10:44 AM
Special guest: Everybody wave hi to Mira.
Things Discussed:
Spring game: Craig watched the line, wasn't that impressed.
Bryce was throwing flat; overthrowing McCulley is a sin. There's a guy across the aisle who's already mad. Seth thinks when the threw that small window past a dropping DE was good; Brian thought he didn't see the drop.
Jadyn Davis: Didn't look that polished but much improved.
Mikey Keene? Brian thinks he's not a P4 quarterback.
Receivers? If you go in the portal you can get a bunch of CJ Charlestons at this point. McCulley had the one contested ball and did the George Costanza.
Keeps the expectations for Bryce in context, because Trevor Lawrence had NFL wideouts to throw at as a freshman. Want guys to step up: Marsh, Browder: turn around and context that. Seth: comp is what Nebraska got out of Raiola last year. Need the running game to be the engine of the offense. Get to functional.
Hey Sam, how many targets is Jalen Hoffman getting?
Are they going to do zone reads for Bryce?
OL: Sprague up, Link down—if they're not naming him the starter now maybe he needs to move inside. Sam thinks Frazier can get healthy and get back his agility. Seth thinks they're gonna survive until Babalola is ready, ETA midseason.
Break: Sam talks about his colon (I left this out of the podcast version).
Defense: Tackles go six deep with big dudes. With them it's more about who they're going against.
Linebacker: We are RICH. Seth thinks we have two guys who are better than the top six guys in the Draft, AND Rolder made it through spring without getting hurt. Barham has many uses, Sam thinks he's going to be an All-American. Sullivan can do Barham things.
Big Nickel Mason Curtis: think this is a thing.
Seth thinks Efobi looked like he was moving them.
Dom Nichols: not surprised that a guy who played a lot as a true freshman is getting talk as DE#3.
Who's got bend? Sam says Barham is #1. Seth wants to see it from Edokpayi.

Push Security raises $30M to expand browser-based identity threat detection
by
Duncan Riley
SHARE
Identity security company
Push Security Ltd.
announced today that it has raised $30 million in new funding to accelerate growth, fuel innovation and global expansion.
Founded in 2020, Push Security specializes in preventing identity-based attacks through a browser-based Identity Threat Detection and Response platform. The company offers a lightweight browser agent that monitors and protects workforce identities in real time to allow organizations to detect and block threats such as phishing, credential stuffing and session hijacking directly within the browser.
Push Security says its browser-based identity security platform detects and intercepts identity attacks before they escalate by securing identities in the browser and, in doing so, closing security gaps left by traditional identity and security solutions. The platform also identifies vulnerabilities like stolen credentials, missing multi-factor authentication controls and non-single sign-on identities, allowing security teams to act proactively to close identity security gaps and stop breaches before they happen.
“Compromised identities are now the prized target for attackers,” said Chief Executive Adam Bateman. “Stolen credentials and phishing remain the top two causes of reported breaches and high-profile incidents, like the
Snowflake breach
last summer, are showing us the massive impact they can have.”
The company’s solution turns employees’ browsers into a powerful telemetry source and control point for stopping identity attacks. The browser extension provides visibility into user interactions with cloud applications, analyzing login behaviors and authentication methods to identify risky activities. The service detects when employees access unauthorized or unmanaged software-as-a-service applications, allowing security teams to enforce policies and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.​
The platform also offers features, including in-browser prompts and app banners, that guide users toward secure practices. For instance, if an employee attempts to log into an application with a weak password, the system can prompt them to strengthen their credentials.
Push Security says it has seen strong growth, serving customers across various industries, including technology, finance and healthcare. In January 2025, Push’s customer base grew 380% year-over-year, off an undisclosed base, and its platform is now deployed on more than 1.5 million endpoints globally.
The Series B funding round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with Datadog Ventures also participating.
“In conversations with CISOs, it is clear that the new critical security perimeter is the browser,” said Erica Brescia, managing director at Redpoint Ventures. “With over 80% of cyberattacks being identity-related, Push is uniquely positioned to protect organizations.”
The new funding takes the amount raise

Mao: My name is George. I am currently a Senior Distinguished Engineer at Capital One. I lead a lot of our AWS serverless technology implementations. I'm responsible for helping our teams implement best practices and everything we do on AWS. Before I joined Capital One, I was the tech leader at AWS for serverless computing, so I spent a lot of time, basically since the beginning of 2015, where serverless was first created at Amazon.
Capital One is one of the largest banks in the United States. We're generally somewhere at 10 or 11 in terms of ranking. We're not that big internationally. We do have a pretty good presence in the UK, but that's about it. What's unique about us is we're mostly structured like a tech organization, so we have about 9,000 software engineers. In 2020, we completed our all-in migration into AWS. As far as I know, I think we're one of the only major banks in the world that has ever done an all-in like this. Now what we're

April 24, 2025
Crooks exploit the death of Pope Francis, using public curiosity and emotion to launch scams and spread malware, an old tactic during global events.
After Pope Francis’ death, cybercriminals launched scams and malware attacks, exploiting public curiosity, grief, and confusion.
Cybercriminals are ready to exploit any event of global interest, it has already happened in the past during events like
Queen Elizabeth II’s death
or the
COVID-19
pandemic. Check Point Research calls this trend “cyber threat opportunism,” noting similar spikes during COVID-19, when Google saw 18M+ daily virus-related scam emails.
These emotionally charged moments are fertile ground for digital exploitation. The emotional vulnerability of users makes them prime targets for attackers seeking clicks, personal data, or financial information.
The death of Pope Francis highlights how cybercriminals exploit any event for malicious gain. Strong security practices and awareness are crucial defenses against such risks.
Disinformation as a Gateway
One of the most dangerous criminal practices associated with these events is
disinformation
. Fake news spreads like wildfire on platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram.
AI-generated
images and videos fuel conspiracy theories, some claim Pope Francis is still alive, and others sensationalize the circumstances of his death.
Source CheckPoint A fake image generated by artificial intelligence, originally spread in February 2025, is reappearing on various websites and social media posts linking to supposed news sites.
These posts, designed to draw clicks and shares, often contain embedded links that redirect users to fraudulent websites.
CheckPoint found a scam where a fake news link led to a bogus Google gift card page. It tricked users into giving up personal info, including payment data.
Hidden Malware and Data Harvesting
Some malicious sites run hidden scripts that silently gather device names, OS, geolocation, and more data later sold on the
dark web
or used for phishing attack
Threat actors used malware to steal login credentials, financial information, and personal files. Experts warn that even seemingly harmless browsing habits can expose you to these risks if you’re not cautious about the websites you visit.
The SEO Poisoning Trap
Cybercriminals use
SEO poisoning
to boost malicious sites in search results for trending terms like “Pope Francis death,” tricking users into visiting harmful pages.
When unsuspecting users search for credible updates, they may unknowingly click on these malicious results. Once they do, they’re exposed to malware or credential-harvesting schemes that often look nearly identical to real news websites. This creates a dangerous feedback loop where trust in online information continues to erode.
Why These Campaigns Are Hard to Detect
A key challenge in these attacks is that cybercriminals use new or dormant domains with no malici

2025-04-26 17:55:04,475 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: WhatsApp introduces Advanced Chat Privacy to protect sensitive communications
Pierluigi Paganini
April 24, 2025
WhatsApp adds Advanced Chat Privacy feature that allows users to block others from sharing chat content outside the app.
WhatsApp announced the availability of a new feature called “Advanced Chat Privacy” for both individual and group chats that enhances content protection. The feature blocks chat exports, auto-media downloads, and the use of messages in AI features, ensuring conversations stay private and within the app.
“Today we’re introducing our latest layer for privacy called “
Advanced Chat Privacy
.” This new setting available in both chats and groups helps prevent others from taking content outside of WhatsApp for when you may want extra privacy.” reads the company’s
announcement
.
“When the setting is on, you can block others from exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features. That way everyone in the chat has greater confidence that no one can take what is being said outside the chat.”
Users can enable Advanced Chat Privacy by tapping the chat name and selecting the new option. The company announced that it is rolling out the feature on the latest WhatsApp version, with more features to come.
“WhatsApp groups are increasingly an extension of our real world networks, some of which are far closer than others. We think this feature is best used when talking with groups where you may not know everyone closely but are nevertheless sensitive in nature, like talking about health challenges in a support group or organizing your community about something important to you.” concludes the announcement.
Since October 2024, WhatsApp has launched
Identity Proof Linked Storage
(IPLS), an encrypted system that binds contact lists to user accounts, enabling secure syncing across devices and preventing contact loss during phone changes.

Your vendor may be the weakest link: Percentage of third-party breaches doubled in a year
2
Cybercriminals are targeting software shops, accountants, lawyers
Connor Jones
Thu 24 Apr 2025
//
09:28 UTC
The percentage of confirmed data breaches involving third-party relationships doubled last year as cybercriminals increasingly exploited weak links in supply chains and partner ecosystems.
That's according to Verizon's Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR) —one of the industry's most-watched autopsies on what actually goes wrong in infosec. This year's edition, released Wednesday, covers incidents that occurred between November 1, 2023, and October 31, 2024.
It found that the proportion of breaches involving third parties rose from 15 percent in last year's dataset to 30 percent in this year's report. This figure includes those breaches (incidents in which data loss was confirmed) caused by exploited software vulnerabilities and supply chain compromises.
Ilia Kolochenko, CEO at ImmuniWeb and fellow at the British Computer Society, said during a
launch event
for the
report
that cybercriminals are increasingly looking at organizations such as accountants and law firms as ways to reach their intended targets.
"Criminals are smart and pragmatic; they count every cent and are cost-conscious," he said, explaining why more vulnerable companies can act as reliable gateways into much bigger target environments.
Verizon said that vendors and other business partners are expanding the attack surface by failing to enforce proper access controls, including preventing credential misuse. In particular, weak third-party practices continue to expose organizations to downstream risks.
One example: in third-party environments, the median time to remediate leaked secrets, such as API keys or tokens discovered in public GitHub repositories, was 94 days, giving attackers ample opportunity to exploit them.
Leaked secrets weren't the only problem. The report also highlights how credential reuse played a key role in several high-profile incidents, including a major Snowflake-related breach, where attackers used previously exposed credentials to access customer accounts due to the lack of mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA).
Other key takeaways:
There are other juicy tidbits in the 117-page report — here are some of the highlights:
Exploiting vulnerabilities for initial access is up 34 percent year over year, now accounting for one in five breaches.
Only 54 percent of perimeter device vulnerabilities were fully remediated, and it took organizations 32 days to do so on average.
44 percent of breaches involved ransomware, a yearly increase of 37 percent.
However, the median ransom payment was down to $115,000, and 64 percent refused to pay up at all.
The human element was a factor in 60 percent of breaches – a figure that's statistically unchanged from the previous year.
State-sponsored attacks with a clear financial focus comprised 28 percent of all those carri

Vector search is the new black for enterprise databases
4
Software slingers from Redis to Teradata are bolting on smarts to stay relevant in GenAI era
Lindsay Clark
Thu 24 Apr 2025
//
08:30 UTC
About two years ago, popular cache database Redis was among a wave of vendors that added vector search capabilities to their platforms, driven by the surge of interest in generative AI.
Vector embeddings are produced by foundational models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and are used to represent chunks of language – like words or phrases. The idea is to add vector search to a database, which allows enterprise systems to store, index, and search millions of vectors extending beyond the foundational models to enterprise data.
Since 2023, so many database systems have announced vector search as a core feature that it hardly distinguishes them from the competition.
For example
, MongoDB, Cassandra, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and SingleStore all announced the same feature in the same year.
Vendors are now trying to differentiate themselves with more in-depth features in the race to become indispensable in the modern AI stack.
For example, Redis announced LangCache. The fully managed REST service is designed to reduce expensive and latency-prone calls to LLMs by caching previous responses to semantically similar queries.
"It sits between your application and whatever LLMs you're using, and you pass in the query, and we see if there's a response that matches, and then we just hand it back to you instead of hitting the LLM inferencing engine," Redis CEO Rowan Trollope told
The Register
earlier this month.
YugabyteDB, the PostgreSQL-compatible database with a distributed back end, is also on a mission to more deeply adapt its software to support AI. With Paramount, GM, and Kroger among its customers, the vendor said that integrating vector indexing libraries including Usearch, HNSWLib, and Faiss would boost the performance of the PostgreSQL vector search extension, pgvector.
Founder and co-CEO Karthik Ranganathan told
The Register
that Yugabyte had replicated and auto-sharded these indexes on its distributed back end to accelerate the performance of pgvector. He argued that while pgvector had the massive community of PostgreSQL behind it, it was reimplementing vector search in the longstanding relational system. It needs performance enhancements to keep up with specialist vector databases.
"Everything in the AI world is going really fast, so we started directly interfacing with some of these open source libraries," he said.
Gartner
said
last year that "moonshot" AI projects in business were seeing high failure rates. Expectations of what GenAI could achieve in business would come down, and 2025 was set to be the "year of the slide."
In other research, Gartner warned that a lack of preparedness in data infrastructure was hampering progress in bringing GenAI to business problems. It predicted that in 2025 and 2026, organizations would abandon 60

2025-04-26 17:55:06,039 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: Android spyware hidden in mapping software targets Russian soldiers
Pierluigi Paganini
April 24, 2025
A new Android spyware was discovered in a fake Alpine Quest app, reportedly used by Russian soldiers for war zone planning.
Doctor Web researchers uncovered a new spyware, tracked as Android.Spy.1292.origin, targeting Russian military personnel. The malicious code was hidden in a trojanized Alpine Quest app and spread via Russian Android catalogs. The malware steals contacts, geolocation, and file info, it can also download extra modules to exfiltrate stored data when instructed.
“Alpine Quest is topographic software that allows different maps to be used both in online and offline mode. It is popular among athletes, travelers, and hunters but also widely used by Russian military personnel in the Special Military Operation zone—and this is what the malware campaign organizers decided to exploit.” reads the
report
published by Doctor Web. Threat actors embedded
Android.Spy.1292.origin
into one of the older Alpine Quest app versions and distributed the trojanized variant under the guise of a freely available version of Alpine Quest Pro, a program with advanced functionality.”
Threat actors set up a fake Telegram channel to distribute the trojanized Alpine Quest app. They shared a link to download the app from a Russian app catalog and later used the same channel to push a malicious “update.”.”
Android.Spy.1292.origin is embedded within a genuine copy of the Alpine Quest app, making it appear and function like the original, to avoid detection. Each time the app is launched, the trojan silently gathers and transmits data such as the user’s phone number, accounts, contact list, current date, geolocation, stored file details, and the app version to a command-and-control server. Simultaneously, it shares some of this data, such as updated geolocation, directly with the attackers’ Telegram bot whenever the device’s location changes.
Once the trojan gathers file information, attackers can instruct it to download and run extra modules to steal specific data. The threat actors behind the malicious app appear interested in confidential documents shared through Telegram and WhatsApp and the locLog file generated by Alpine Quest. This enables Android.Spy.1292.origin to track user locations and exfiltrate sensitive files. Its modular design also allows it to expand its capabilities and perform a broader range of malicious activities.
“As a result,
Android.Spy.1292.origin
not only allows user locations to be monitored but also confidential files to be hijacked. In addition, its functionality can be expanded via the download of new modules, which allows it to then execute a wider spectrum of malicious tasks.” concludes the report.
The researchers recommend downloading Android apps only from trusted sources like official app stores, avoiding Telegram channels and shady sites, especially those offering free versions of paid apps. Users should also verify app distrib

2025-04-26 17:55:08,873 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: Crypto mining campaign targets Docker environments with new evasion technique
Pierluigi Paganini
April 23, 2025
New malware campaign targets Docker environments using unknown methods to secretly mine cryptocurrency, researchers warn.
Researchers from
Darktrace and Cado Security
have spotted a malware campaign that targets Docker environments with a novel technique to mine cryptocurrency.
The malware campaign targets Docker environments to deploy a malicious node connected to Teneo, a decentralized infrastructure network.
Teneo
allows users to earn rewards (
Teneo Points
) by running Community Nodes that scrape public data from social platforms like Facebook, X, Reddit, and TikTok. These points can be converted to $TENEO tokens. The malware covertly monetizes social media bandwidth via this mechanism.
The attack chain begins with a request to launch a container from Docker Hub, specifically the
kazutod/tene:ten
image.
To analyze the malicious Docker image
kazutod/tene:ten
, researchers used Docker tools to pull and save it as a tar file for easier inspection.
Upon extracting the tar, the experts found the image uses the OCI format, where contents are organized in layers. Each layer is stored as a tar file with accompanying JSON metadata, rather than a traditional file system.
“The Docker image uses the OCI format, which is a little different to a regular file system. Instead of having a static folder of files, the image consists of layers. Indeed, when running the file command over the sha256 directory, each layer is shown as a tar file, along with a JSON metadata file.” reads the
report
published by DarkTrace. “As the detailed layers are not necessary for analysis, a single command can be used to extract all of them into a single directory, recreating what the container file system would look like:”
The researchers analyzed the
ten.py
script included in the malicious Docker image and discovered that it is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of base64 encoding, zlib compression, and string reversal. The script decodes and executes a payload repeatedly, each time generating another encoded string to decode, requiring 63 iterations before the actual malicious code is revealed. The researchers pointed out that despite the complex obfuscation process, the decoding process was easily automated, suggesting the effort was likely meant to deter casual analysis rather than seriously hinder experts.
The malicious script connects to
teneo[.]pro
, however, instead of scraping, the malware sends fake keep-alive pings to earn “Teneo Points” based on activity levels. This tactic allows evading common detection techniques for XMRig-based cryptojacking attacks. The attacker’s DockerHub profile suggests similar abuse of decentralized compute networks. However, due to the closed nature of private tokens like Teneo, it’s unclear how profitable this method is.
The attacker’s DockerHub profile shows a pattern of abuse, with their latest container running a Nexus n

Spring Game Takes: Defense
Brian
April 23rd, 2025 at 1:57 PM
Also:
offense
. This one is shorter because the defense holds little mystery until you get beyond the two-deep, and I was almost entirely focused on the QBs.
Defensive Line
This is largely a N/A, as Michigan has the luxury of entering this year with a starting lineup consisting entirely of players with hundreds of snaps at high-end P4 schools. Their top backup, whether it's Damon Payne or Tre Williams, will also fit in that box. Meanwhile heavy rotation made it somewhat difficult for any particular player to stand out. Moore did
make it sound
like there are interior guys moving up into rotation roles:
On the defensive tackle position:
It is super deep. You start with a guy like Rayshaun Benny who's been here and played a lot of football. He's been an impact player, and he's been sitting behind guys every year, but he's played every year. He's got the experience in the big games. He's got the experience in every game possible to know what it looks like and how it prepares, and he's been great.
A guy like Ike Iwunnah, to watch him, where he's been. He was a guy that's been on scout team two years ago. Now a guy that's in the rotation. I can go down the list: Damon Payne, transfer. Tré Williams has been an impact player for us. Trey Pierce is a young guy who played a lot in the bowl game and then Enow Etta. So you've got six guys right there that you feel like you can throw in the game and be ready to play.
Two youngsters vying to pop through into meaningful playing time did pop out. DT
Deyvid Palepale
is a pleasingly rectangular human who made some plays in the run game and gives off Bryan Mone vibes.
Dominic Nichols
had the best edge rush of the day on a virtual sack. Unfortunately Nichols got dinged up shortly thereafter and ended up taking off his pads to become a spectator the rest of the day.
Nichols was one of four DEs to draw mention from Moore, along with the starters and Cam Brandt; Nichols was explicitly #3. He's going to be a guy to watch early this fall to see how much of a leap he can make.
[After THE JUMP: other players]
Linebacker
Again, this is not a spot that carries a lot of mystery for Michigan. Hausman and Barham will start and were given the quick hook. Behind, we've seen enough of
Jimmy Rolder
to have a feel for what he does. And in
Cole Sullivan
, Michigan seems to have nearly a one-for-one replacement for Barham rolling through. Sullivan is another LB/DE hybrid type, like Barham, and seems to have the athleticism to make the LB half of that equation plausible, like Barham. His ability to move around the field fluidly at his size popped out.
That's your two-deep, give or take Georgia transfer Troy Bowles, who's not on campus yet.

Let’s be honest, we’re all suckers for over-engineered watches that can handle the crushing pressures of the ocean depths, even if the deepest water they’ll ever see is a hotel swimming pool. As fellow watch enthusiasts who work office jobs by day and play weekend warriors outside of the 9-to-5, we’ve assembled this guide to the best GADA (Go Anywhere, Do Anything) dive watches for everyday wear- the ultimate guide to one of our favorite categories: the beloved desk diver.
While we’ve been fortunate enough to take a few actual dives off the Pacific coast here in LA, our watches spend far more time under shirt cuffs than wetsuit sleeves. But that’s the beauty of a
great dive watch
: it’s built to survive the harshest environments on earth, yet versatile enough to complement your business casual attire on Monday morning.

The watch industry is literally filled with dive watches of all kinds. That’s why, for this guide, we focused on the aforementioned GADA divers. Using our years of knowledge in the space, we looked to our favorite brands, sticking to a sub-$5,000 budget and focusing on models that are more style than utility. Looking at products across all price points in our range, we sourced these watches for testing, getting hands-on with each and every piece, spending days with them on our wrist. We looked at look, feel, comfort, and wrist presence, among other things. Our results are detailed below.
Tester:
For reference, all watches were tested on a 6.75″ wrist.
Our Criteria
We set a cut off point of $5,000 (trying to cover every budget along the way), and focused on watches that come on bracelets, as we believe this is the most versatile option for transitioning between environments and the best choice for true everyday wear. Each watch also has 200m of water resistance. And while most watches f

Tudor's Black Bay Pro Gets A Surprisingly Dramatic Facelift With An Opaline Dial
Why I sold my original Black Bay Pro and why this new dial is making me reconsider it.
TanTan Wang
April 23, 2025

This year, Tudor has added a new dial to the Black Bay Pro lineup. Since the model's one and only variant was introduced back in 2022, folks have been speculating when the next update would be, especially as the Black Bay 58 GMT was introduced last summer as a significantly thinner option in the family. Would that mean that the MT5652, as a 7.5mm tall GMT caliber, would now be obsolete in light of this new thinner MT5450-U movement?
Alas, the MT5652 is here to stay. We all should have expected as much when, in December, Tudor released the Pelagos FXD GMT with the same movement. So with this new Black Bay Pro, all we get is a new dial — no updated case or caliber. But a new dial can go a long way in invigorating a model while still keeping to the same formula. On paper, this is a very insignificant update. Black dial model gets a new white dial version? A tale as old as time. But I do think that this new Black Bay Pro warrants a closer look because it's making me think about this watch in a new light.
Most specs on this update remain the same. The case is still a reasonable 39mm in diameter with 20mm lugs, while keeping that oft-complained-about thickness of 14.6mm. Granted, while the height is in part due to a very tall and pronounced crystal (even more exaggerated because of the thinner fixed bezel on the Black Bay Pro), the cases of the Black Bay line often draw more criticism due to their slab sides. A simpler, blockier case means less in the way of visual trickery when it comes to making a case optically thinner, as we've seen many other brands do successfully. On the wrist, it is ironically the smaller diameter of the watch that makes it seem taller than it really is. Even with the hefty faux-rivet bracelet with adjustable T-fit clasp, the Black Bay Pro presents as a more top-heavy wearing experience (more on that in a little bit).
Surrounding the tall sapphire crystal is that fixed bezel, which I find very attractively beveled with a contrasting polished finish on the side to give a little bit of glimmer to an otherwise very industrial design. And of course, this all leads to this new opaline (or as everyone would say in the halls of the Palexpo, white) dial. As far as Tudor dials go, this might be one of my favorites. It is refreshing, clean, and legible. Something I absolutely loved about my original black dial variant was the rough texturing of the hands, thankfully staying the same in this version. The black dial Black Bay Pro's "phantom" hands are gone, with the exception of the brig

Rethink authentication to remove the burden on users
The rise of AI powered threats and non-human identities will push an already strained identity security model over the edge
Share this item with your network:
By
Patrick Wardrop, IBM
Published:
23 Apr 2025
Attackers exploit human nature, making authentication a prime target. The Snowflake
data breach
is a clear example – hackers used stolen customer credentials, many which lacked multi-factor authentication (MFA), to breach several customer accounts, steal sensitive data and reportedly extort dozens of companies. This incident highlights how one seemingly small, compromised credential can have severe consequences.
Phishing scams, credential stuffing, and account takeovers all succeed because authentication still depends on users making security decisions. But no amount of security training can completely stop people from being tricked into handing over their credentials, downloading malware that steals login information, or reusing passwords that can be easily exploited. The problem isn’t the user; it’s the system that requires them to be the last line of defense.
With agentic AI set to introduce a surge of non-human identities (NHIs) - bringing an added layer of complexity to an already complicated IT environment - enterprises need to rethink authentication, removing users from the process as much, and as soon, as possible.
Identity and access management’s (IAM) evolution: From gatekeeper to open door
The explosion of cloud applications, systems and data has made
identity security
more complex and critical than ever before. Today, the average enterprise manages multiple cloud environments and around
1,000 applications
, creating a highly fragmented landscape, which attackers are actively capitalising on. In fact, IBM’s
2025 Threat Intelligence Index
found that most of the cyber attacks investigated last year were caused by cybercriminals using stolen employee credentials to breach corporate networks.
With AI-driven attacks set to make this problem even worse, identity abuse shows no signs of a slowdown. Large language models (LLMs) can automate spear-phishing campaigns and scrape billions of exposed credentials to fuel automated identity attacks. With AI enabling attackers to scale their tactics, the transition away from credential-based security must become a priority for businesses.
Beyond credentials: Letting technology handle authentication
The future of secure modern authentication requires reducing the user burden from the identity paradigm by moving away from passwords and knowledge-based authentication.
Passwordless authentication, based on the
FIDO
(Fast Identity Online) standard replaces traditional passwords with cryptography keys bound to a user’s account on an application or website. Instead of choosing and remembering a password, users authenticate with biometrics or a hardware-backed credential, this is typically provided by the device (laptop

Datadog sees data observability join DevOps, adds Metaplane
Datadog has customers already bringing data science under DevOps and, with its latest acquisition, aims to create a unified tool set for the newly converged combo.

23 Apr 2025
Digital transformation and AI have some enterprises consolidating data science and DevOps teams, Datadog officials said. The vendor plans to offer them data observability baked into its platform later this year, based on its acquisition of Metaplane.
The data observability startup, founded in Boston in 2019, uses machine learning to automatically alert for issues with data quality and delivery in big data warehouse systems such as
Snowflake
. The two companies share joint customers but declined to say how many. Metaplane competitors in data observability include Acceldata, Monte Carlo and Soda Data.
Metaplane's founder, Kevin Hu, and his engineering team will join Datadog and rewrite the company's software to run on Datadog's observability platform. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Michael Whetten
Datadog chose to acquire Metaplane because it's both willing and able to rewrite its tools to run on Datadog, according to Michael Whetten, vice president of product at Datadog. For now, Metaplane will continue to support existing customers as Metaplane by Datadog, but Whetten said its IP will be ported to the Datadog platform within the year. After that, customers will need to move to Datadog to continue to use Metaplane data observability.
The deal came about because Datadog has already seen some customers bring
DataOps
and DevOps teams together and begin to ask for unified tools in the last year, Whetten said.
"We saw that data engineers and data teams were starting to consolidate budgets under the CTO and the application team," Whetten said in an interview with Informa TechTarget. "There was an indication that these things were moving out of just business intelligence, which is still critical, toward real-time operations at scale."
Kevin Hu
Metaplane also had customers asking it to cover more of the IT infrastructure used for data processing, including
data pipeline
tools such as Kafka, according to Hu.
"Data comes from somewhere -- a system, or input by a human, and unfortunately, Metaplane and the current cohort of data observability customers just don't have that visibility," Hu said. "We're not connected to the Kafka stream. We're not connected to the upstream database or to upstream software systems. So when our customers naturally ask the 'What happened?' question, we just simply don't have an answer."
Ultimately, porting Metaplane into Datadog will add more value for users, he said.
"We don't know exactly how it's going to look or what form it's going to take, but now we have data to answer that question of exactly what happened," Hu said. "And if you're writing software or you're on

Sarah Palin’s libel loss was her second attempt to claim she had been damaged by a 2017 New York Times editorial that was amended less than 14 hours after it was published. “During the trial, Ms. Palin
told the jury
that the editorial ‘kicked the oomph’ right out of her, damaging her reputation,”
The Times
reported. “She said it had ignited another round of criticism of her years after the map was first distributed.”
Poor widdle snowflake.
The AP
explains the legal case:
Her lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington.
In the editorial, the Times wrote that before the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others, Palin’s political action committee had contributed to an atmosphere of violence by circulating a map of electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.
The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published, saying it had “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting” and that it had “incorrectly described” the map.
The AP further noted that the Times’ then-editorial page editor “
tearfully apologized
to Palin,” during the trial, “saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper.”
Personally, I think the editorial pales in comparison to the hideous rhetoric that routinely comes from MAGA world. That includes putting out a map with crosshairs over Democratic districts. Or Palin, herself, accusing Barack Obama of “
palling around with terrorists
,” e.g.
But Palin’s suit is not really about the harm she allegedly suffered from a 14-hour insult from The Times. It’s “widely understood” that the real goal has been to get the case to the Trumpy Supreme Court where Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas have already “shown an openness to altering U.S. libel law to make it easier to sue media outlets,” Ja’han Jones wrote in an
MSNBC.com
blog post.
“Palin declined to say whether she would appeal the verdict,”
The Times
also reported. “Outside the court after the verdict, Ms. Palin said she was going to ‘go home to a beautiful family’ and ‘get on with life.’

Phishing has declined as a method of initial access in 2024 and is now behind credential theft and vulnerability exploitation, according to Mandiant’s
M-Trends 2025 Report
.
This continues a trend observed over several year, with email phishing falling from 22% to 14% for initial access from 2022 to 2024.
Vulnerability exploitation was the most common method of infiltrating targets in 2024, making up 33% of cases. However, this marks a significant
decline from 38%
in 2023.
The use of stolen credentials for initial access jumped from 10% to 16% from 2023 to 2024, making it the second most common technique.

Mandiant noted that the fall in phishing and rise in stolen credentials is largely due to the growing ability of threat actors to obtain credentials in a variety of ways. This includes:
Purchasing leaked or stolen credentials on underground forums
Mining large data leaks for credentials
Infecting users with keyloggers and infostealers
Another notable initial access trend was insider threats, making up 5% of vectors. The researchers highlighted a surge in fake
North Korean IT worker
campaigns as a major contributor to this trend.

Infostealers Leading to Surge in Stolen Credentials
The report highlighted a
renewed focus by threat actors on infostealers
– malware designed to collect and steal sensitive user data such as credentials, browser data and cookies, email data and cryptocurrency wallets.
Infostealers create unique challenges for organizations as they can collect wide swaths of user data and credentials from a single host. This is unlike techniques such as phishing and credential stuffing, which target credentials for a specific system.
Additionally, when employees or contractors leverage personal devices for work purposes, infostealers can fall outside the scope enterprise security and detection measures.
A major example of the use of infostealers was during the compromise of
multiple Snowflake customers
in a campaign starting in April 2024. Snowflake is a cloud data warehousing platform.
These credentials were primarily obtained from infostealer malware campaigns that infected the work or personal computers of employees and contractors who accessed Snowflake customer instances.
Prominent infostealer variants used last year included Vidar, Resepro, Redline, Raccoon stealer,
Lumma
and Metastealer.
Phishing the Biggest Driver of Cloud Compromises
Despite the overall reduction in email phishing for initial access, this technique was the most common initial infection
vector for cloud environments
, at 39%.
This was followed by stolen credentials (35%), SIM swapping (6%) and voice phishing or vishing (6%).

Stolen credentials edge out email tricks for cloud break-ins because they're so easy to get

Criminals used stolen credentials more frequently than email phishing to gain access into their victims' IT systems last year, marking the first time that compromised login details claimed the number two spot in Mandiant's list of most common initial infection vectors.
"Credential stealers have been and are a major issue, but we have seen a resurgence recently," Mandiant Consulting VP Jurgen Kutscher said in an interview with
The Register
about the nearly 100-page M-Trends 2025
report
from the Google-owned security shop.
"Email tends to be noisier and easier to detect with phishing detection," he added. "There is an entire cybercrime business surrounding stolen credentials that promotes the sale – and use – of stolen credentials."
The annual report also found 55 percent of attackers active in 2024 were financially motivated, up slightly from 52 percent the year before. Only 8 percent were motivated by espionage last year, which represents a 2 percent drop from 2023.
In 2024, Mandiant began tracking 737 new threat clusters, bringing the total number of groups on its radar to more than 4,500. Across last year's incident response engagements, the team observed 302 different threat groups, 233 of which were newly identified.
But the parts that piqued our interest – and likely will prove the most useful to defenders trying to keep the baddies off their networks – involved how attackers are breaking in, usually to steal data, demand ransoms, or sometimes both.
Exploits remained the top entry point overall for the fifth straight year. In cloud compromises, however, phishing led at 39 percent, with stolen credentials close behind at 35 percent.
New to this year's report is that Mandiant tracked the overall initial infection vector, but then also broke out cloud attacks and ransomware into their own separate sections.
How ransomware gangs gain initial access
It found the most commonly observed initial infection vector for ransomware infections was brute-force attacks (26 percent) followed by stolen credentials (21 percent).
Brute-force intrusions into victim environments highlight "the opportunistic nature of ransomware and multifaceted extortion," Kutscher told
The Register
. Attacks of this nature include password spraying, using default credentials across multiple virtual private network (VPN) devices, and high-volume login attempts against a remote desktop server.
A lot of those attacks are not targeted at any one specific company, but threat actors looking to see where they can break in, and where they can cause the most damage

2025-04-26 17:55:15,212 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: AI-generated code is no doubt changing how software is built, but it’s also introducing new security challenges. More than 50% of organizations encounter security issues with AI-produced code sometimes or frequently, according to a late 2023
survey by developer security platform Synk
.
For
Endor Labs
, that opportunity proved alluring enough that it chose to change course somewhat. Endor started off helping companies secure their open source package dependencies — in fact, it even
raised a $70 million Series A round
just two years ago to grow its developer pipeline governance service.
But the startup’s co-founders, Varun Badhwar and Dimitri Stiliadis, saw growing demand elsewhere — spotting and combating vulnerabilities in the growing masses of code that engineers use AI to generate and fine-tune.
Today, Endor runs a platform that, it claims, can not only review code and identify risks, but also recommend “precise” fixes and apply them automatically. The company offers a plug-in for AI-powered programming tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot that scans code as it’s written and flags issues.
The pivot could prove to be a wise choice. On Wednesday, Endor announced that it closed a $93 million Series B round led by DFJ Growth, with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Coatue, Dell Technologies Capital, Section 32, and Citi Ventures.
Badhwar (CEO) said that the round values Endor at “orders of magnitude higher” than its
Series A
valuation. The proceeds will be used to expand Endor’s platform, he added. The Series B brings the startup’s total capital raised to $163 million.
“This new round positions us to continue delivering, even in a tougher macro environment than similar companies faced five to 10 years ago,” Badhwar told TechCrunch. “We raised now because we’re seeing strong momentum — 30x annual recurring revenue growth since our Series A in 2023 — and this lets us double down on delivering outcomes for our customers.”

Several months ago, Endor launched a tool designed to help organizations spot where AI models and services integrate with their codebase, and evaluate the integrations for security flaws. The idea is to provide better oversight as AI programming tools proliferate, said Badhwar.
Endor says it now protects more than 5 million applications and runs over a million scans each week for customers including OpenAI, Rubrik, Peloton, Snowflake, Egnyte, and Dropbox.
“We came out of stealth in October 2022 — right as interest rates spiked — and we’ve seen strong traction ever since,” Badhwar said.
Ramin Sayar, venture partner at DFJ Growth, said his firm invested because Endor found itself at the right place, at the right time.
“As generative AI transforms coding practices, developers are generating vast amounts of code without thorough visibility and control,” Sayar told TechCrunch. “Endor Labs is not only setting a new stan

2025-04-26 17:55:17,405 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: The popular xrpl.js Ripple cryptocurrency library was compromised in a supply chain attack
Pierluigi Paganini
April 23, 2025
The
xrpl.js
Ripple cryptocurrency library was compromised in a supply chain attack aimed at stealing users’ private keys.
Threat actors compromised the Ripple cryptocurrency npm JavaScript library
xrpl.js
to harvest users’ private keys.
xrpl.js
is the recommended library for integrating a JavaScript/TypeScript app with the XRP, it has more than 140.000 weekly downloads. Hundreds of thousands of applications and websites use this package, the package has been
downloaded
over 2.9 million times to date.
On April 21, Aikido Intel detected that the official
xrpl
NPM package was compromised with a backdoor as part of a supply chain attack.
“At 21 Apr, 20:53 GMT+0, our system,
Aikido Intel
started to alert us to five new package version of the
xrpl
package. It is the official SDK for the XRP Ledger, with more than 140.000 weekly downloads.” reads the
report
published by Aikido. “We quickly confirmed the official XPRL (Ripple) NPM package was compromised by sophisticated attackers who put in a backdoor to steal cryptocurrency private keys and gain access to cryptocurrency wallets. “
The researchers investigated the supply chain attack and discovered that five
xrpl
package versions (4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 2.14.2) contained malicious code. The user
'mukulljangid
‘ released all five malware-laced versions of the library starting from 21 Apr, 20:53 GMT+0.
The researchers noticed the presence of a function named checkValidityOfSeed in the code that was used to exfiltrate the stolen information to the domain “0x9c [.] xyz”.
At this time, it is unclear who is behind the attack, however, the experts pointed out that multiple version bumps occurred as attackers refined their methods. Version 4.2.1 removed key configs; 4.2.2 introduced malicious JavaScript. Later versions (4.2.3, 4.2.4) added backdoors in TypeScript, showing the attacker’s evolving tactics to avoid detection and moving from manual code insertion to compiled backdoors.
The problem has been fixed in
versions 4.2.5 and 2.14.3
.
Users of the xrpl.js library are urged to update to versions 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to mitigate risks from the recent supply chain attack.
The company provided indicators of compromise to check whether users’ systems may have been affected by the malicious versions of the library.

2025-04-26 17:55:21,031 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: Chinese Cybercriminals Released Z-NFC Tool for Payment Fraud
Pierluigi Paganini
April 23, 2025
Cybercriminals leverage NFC fraud against ATMs and POS terminals, stealing money from consumers at scale.
Resecurity (USA) investigated multiple incidents identified in Q1 2025, exceeding several million dollars in damages for one of the top Fortune 100 financial institutions in the United States due to NFC fraud. Stopping cybercriminals operating from China presents significant challenges due to geopolitical, technical, and organizational factors.
Cybersecurity experts identified multiple Chinese cybercriminal groups targeting Google and Apple Wallet customers. Their TTPs center on the abuse of contactless payments and the misuse of the NFC technology to conduct fraud. The analysts from Resecurity’s HUNTER unit
identified
a group on Telegram offering the
Z-NFC tool
for sale to facilitate fraudulent transactions. Another tool, called
King NFC
, was previously marketed on the
Dark Web
as an alternative.
Primarily, the actors use Android-based phones, with numerous cards “loaded” into mobile wallets for further fraud. In one such instance, cybercriminals specifically focused on fraud automation against
Barclays
,
Bank of Scotland
,
Lloyds Banking Group
,
Halifax
,
HSBC
,
Santander
,
Wise
and
Revolut
.
How do those apps work? They all use Host Card Emulation (HCE) to mimic a physical ISO 14443 NFC smart card by registering a service that extends HostApduService. This allows the app to respond to APDU command sequences like a card. APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) commands are the standardized communication units used between a smart card reader and a smart card. Cybercriminals exploit the same approach by manipulating HCE for malicious purposes to process compromised credit card data via NFC.
Why is NFC-enabled fraud still possible? Traditional payments typically require some Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) such as PIN or signature. For low-value contactless payments below the “Contactless CVM limit,” no CVM is required – the consumer can simply Tap & Go. Unfortunately, cybercriminals actively exploit this issue by executing multiple small transactions while leveraging a high volume of compromised cards.
Besides traditional POS terminals, according to Resecurity, cybercriminals also abuse tap on phone software solutions (called Soft POS) that turns NFC-enabled Android smartphones, tablets and other handheld devices into payment terminals.
Today, it is estimated that
1.9 billion phones
worldwide are NFC-enabled, showcasing its rapid adoption.

From CRM giant to ‘digital labor’ provider: How Salesforce aims to stand above the hype with agentic AI

As more vendors rebrand automation as agents, established giants and startups alike are challenged to show agentic AI delivers real business value — not just hype.
Among the most ambitious is Salesforce, which aims to do for AI what it did for enterprise software.
Last week, Salesforce
highlighted
growth for its Data Cloud and Agentforce platforms, reporting $900 million in annual recurring revenue for fiscal 2025 and 3,000 net-new Agentforce deals in the fourth quarter. The company is pitching these tools as the foundation tapping into what it sees as a potential
$6 trillion “digital labor market”
— which comprises
AI agents
powering marketing, sales, and service workflows.
Agentforce and Data Cloud are the platforms driving Salesforce’s agentic AI strategy. Agentforce, which debuted last fall, enables companies to deploy
autonomous AI agents
. Meanwhile, Data Cloud, its customer data platform, first debuted in 2020 as
Customer 360 Audiences
before evolving through several rebrands before becoming Data Cloud in 2023.
Companies like CaixaBank, Maserati, OpenTable, and Pfizer are already using Agentforce and Data Cloud to power agents with CRM and other data. Other examples include Equinox and Wyndham Hotels, which are leveraging the platforms for real-time, personalized marketing and customer experiences across global markets.
The challenge for companies like Salesforce and others is to show how new agentic workflows actually differ from past forms of automation. The old model was driven by bots and deterministic rule-based systems merely pre-wired to take specific actions, said Rahul Auradkar, Salesforce’s GM and EVP of Unified Data Services.
“The new world of AI is rewriting those rules, and the re-writing of those rules is determined at the moment based on the information you have provided and you’ve grounded it with,” Auradkar told Digiday.
A key factor for Salesforce’s agentic strategy is its cloud and agent architecture. Auradkar said customers can buil

“Explosion of diversity”
The goal isn’t total standardization
How organizations deal with this today
What now?
Earthly Lunar: Monitoring for the SDLC
Finally
Last year, our team spent a lot of time interviewing fellow Platform, DevOps, DevEx, CI/CD, and SRE engineers, as well as engineering leaders, in order to better understand their day-to-day challenges. We began this effort to see how
Earthfiles
, one of our products, could serve engineering teams at scale. But as we spoke to more and more people, we realized that platform engineering as an industry is on a collision course with something far more painful and visceral than just
build speed
.
It was the summer of 2024, and we needed to turn open-source success into commercial success for Earthfiles. Eleven thousand GitHub stars. How hard could it be to monetize that traction?
To make venture-scale money, we needed to go up-market and figure out what makes mid-size companies and enterprises tick and how our product might be able to help them. So we started interviewing platform and engineering leaders across the industry. DocuSign, Affirm, Roblox, Palo Alto Networks, Twilio, LinkedIn, Box, Morgan Stanley, BNY, and many more. We spoke to over 100 of these.
We started with a simple question:
What are the top issues that you’re struggling with in your day-to-day work?
We were hoping to get validation that developer productivity is a top concern and then be able to further narrow down how CI/CD speed would be able to unlock developer efficiency. But of all these interviews, only one mentioned build speed as a top issue, and it was largely biased by a recent production incident where they couldn’t get the fix out quickly enough due to a slow end-to-end CI/CD process.
In fact, the top issues they typically mentioned had nothing to do with productivity - not on the surface, anyway. It had to do more with how to best manage the engineering chaos that becomes inevitable at scale. You see, in the era of containers and microservices, there has been a general trend for companies to give more and more freedom to individual dev teams. It’s a container - if it slots in nicely in production, there’s less of a concern about what’s
inside
the container.

The increased freedom results in an
explosion of diversity
at the dev infrastructure layer. Within any given company, you’ll find a mix of programming languages, CI technol

2025-04-26 17:55:25,800 INFO extract_article_content[None]: first 3000 chars: Millions of SK Telecom customers are potentially at risk following USIM data compromise
Pierluigi Paganini
April 22, 2025
SK Telecom warned that threat actors accessed customer Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) info through a malware attack.
SK Telecom is South Korea’s largest wireless telecom company, a major player in the country’s mobile and tech landscape.
It holds about 48% of the market share for mobile services, meaning around 34 million subscribers use its network. The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure.
The carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more).
SK Telecom reported threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys.
The telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date.
SK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts.
The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the ‘SIM protection service’ for free.
“On April 19, 2025, at approximately 11:00 PM, SK Telecom discovered circumstances in which some SIM-related information of SK Telecom customers was suspected to have been leaked due to malware.” reads the
data breach notification
published by the company. “SK Telecom immediately deleted the malware after recognizing the possibility of a leak and isolated the suspected hacking device. As of now, there have been no confirmed cases of actual exploitation of the information, but we are implementing the following measures to prevent damage to our customers.”
The company is still investigating the security breach to determine the exact cause, the scale of the incident, and determine the leaked data. The South Korean provider also reported the data leak to the Personal Information Protection Commission at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 22.
Customers who want additional security measures could sign up for

When it comes to dial design, Grand Seiko is perhaps the most revered name in the watch industry. With models inspired by the seasons, its nation’s cultural history, and the milieu of its two main studios, the Japanese watchmaker has plenty of models for the discerning buyer. Yet, one dial design in particular remains its most iconic (as well as our personal favorite): the “Snowflake”, presented here as the
Spring Drive SBGA211
.

Debuting in 2005 in Japan (globally in 2010), the “Snowflake” dial isn’t merely a blanket of snow-inspired white but the result of an innovative, multi-step process. An accumulation of over 80 separate steps, the dial process begins with stamping a brass plate with a textured pattern and leads to a special brushing technique, silver plating, coating, and eventually the finishing touches, all evoking the look of freshly fallen snow. For the SBGA211, it’s displayed inside a 41mm case made of high-intensity titanium, which is not only known for its high scratch and corrosion resistance but also for being 30% lighter than stainless steel.

Of course, if you think beauty is only skin deep, Grand Seiko’s Spring Drive movement is here to prove you wrong. Inside the wintery watch is this hybrid wonder, blending the best of both mechanical and quartz calibers. Basically, the mainspring of a traditional mechanical movement gets wound, thus powering the hands as it
un
winds. However, for the Spring Drive — which is the result of over two decades of R&D — the accuracy of the mainspring is managed by an electromagnetic speed-regulating unit. Displayed through the exhibition caseback, the Caliber 9R65 Spring Drive creates a smooth gliding seconds hand and also boasts a 72-hour power reserve, tracked on a dial-side indicator.

Available now from Grand Seiko’s website, the Spring Drive SBGA211 “Snowflake” is priced at $6,600.

A millennial mom's video about her boomer parents has sparked a viral conversation about what many are calling a "generational tradition"—bringing literal carloads of stuff into their adult children's homes, whether they like it or not.
Rose Grady, 34, from Central Ohio, shared a
viral TikTok video
that's racked up over 3 million views. The clip shows her peering out the window as her parents arrive, with bags in tow and "treasures" galore.
The overlay text read: "Just a millennial mom watching her boomer parents bring three full loads of 'treasures' into her home."
In the video, Grady's parents were unloading multiple bags and items from their car, a sight many millennials said is all too familiar.
Grady and her friend Maddy share their
TikTok
account where they post humorous videos about their lives and families.

"The moment my parents arrived to visit my family this past weekend, rolled down the window and yelled out they had a full trunk to unload, I thought of this TikTok idea to share. Whenever there is a visit with my parents, we always have new 'treasures' to unpack," Grady told
Newsweek
.
Among those treasures? Childhood clothes, nostalgic keepsakes, and plenty of "just in case" items.
"My mom kept chests full of my old clothes from infancy and childhood. Some of the dresses are absolutely beautiful—dresses from the '90s were made differently than they are now. I do love dressing my daughter in some of my old outfits," she said.
As well as old treasures, her parents also love to find a deal, often arriving with new sale discoveries for the kids. "As a millennial, our generation is caught between the thrill of deal
hunting and thrifting

Proofpoint Debuts Unified Data Security Protection Across Data Exfiltration, Exposure and Insider Threats
Proofpoint, Inc
. announced the
launch of the industry's first unified data security solution designed
to simplify one of the most complex and fragmented challenges
organizations face: locating their data, classifying it correctly,
controlling who can access it, and monitoring how people interact with
it across all channels, from endpoints and email to the web and the
cloud.
Organizations
 today face escalating data security risks driven by uncontrolled data
sprawl across cloud apps, collaboration tools, endpoints, and AI
services-often beyond the visibility of security teams. The vendor
landscape has only intensified this challenge, offering fragmented,
single-channel data loss prevention and other point solutions that
prevent security teams from gaining a complete view of their data
exposure. The rapid adoption of generative AI compounds the problem, as
employees increasingly interact with sensitive data in unpredictable
ways. Proofpoint's
2024 Data Loss Landscape Report
reveals that 85% of organizations experienced a data loss incident last year, and over a quarter of enterprises don't know where their sensitive data resides.
Proofpoint's
 new unified data security approach addresses these challenges head-on
by combining data loss prevention (DLP), data security posture
management (DSPM), and insider threat management into a single, unified
architecture. Built on
Proofpoint Nexus
-
 which combines AI models, behavioral analytics, and human risk
intelligence across every control point - and new AI agents, this
solution enables organizations to locate their sensitive data,
understand its nature, govern access, prevent most data loss, and
monitor any risky actions that cannot be prevented.
"Securing
 data is fundamentally a human problem, amplified by growing data sprawl
 and increasing complexity," said Mayank Choudhary, executive vice
president and general manager, Data Security Group at Proofpoint. "With
today's announcement, we are redefining how organizations approach data
security. Our unified platform converges DLP, DSPM, and insider threat
management to eliminate the patchwork of point solutions that fail to
meet the demands of today's AI-first, data-centric world. It is
adaptive, intelligent, and prepared for an agentic AI future."
Data Security Transformed: Intelligent, Agent-Driven, and Adaptive
Like
 many other cybersecurity challenges, data security is conceptually
simple but has proven very difficult to implement at scale. If security
teams had unlimited resources and time, they could easily classify every
 document and data store, ensure that only the right people and accounts
 had access to it, and monitor alerts on anything that looked unusual.
In the real world, however, few teams have the resources they would like
 to apply to protecting their data.

Descope launches Agentic Identity Hub to simplify authentication for AI agents and workflows
by
Duncan Riley
SHARE
Authentication and user management platform company
Descope Inc.
today announced the launch of Agentic Identity Hub, a platform that helps organizations solve authentication and authorization challenges for artificial intelligence agents, systems and workflows.
The new platform includes the ability to provide apps with an easy way to become agent-ready while requiring user consent. That provides agents a scalable way to connect with more than 50 third-party tools and enterprise systems. In turn, that helps developers using
model context protocol
— Anthropic PBC’s open-source standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives — protect their MCP servers with purpose-built authorization application programming interfaces and software development kits.
The platform seeks to address the issue wherein agents, large language models and other AI systems have become increasingly embedded into enterprise and consumer workflows. As a result, developers are struggling to securely connect AI systems to external software-as-a-service tools and ensure that their own apps properly authenticate AI agents with the right level of access and human oversight.
Descope argues that as the industry converges on a few key standards to power identity infrastructure for agentic builds, such as 0Auth and MCP, developers face the choice between spending time to become experts in these protocols to build and manage authentication for AI systems, or risking identity spoofing, tool misuse, privilege compromise and other threats.
The new Agentic Identity Hub addresses these issues with capabilities that include support for inbound apps, providing every application an easy way to become its own identity provider using the OAuth standard. Doing so allows AI agents to authenticate, access authorized user data and take scoped actions securely on behalf of users with their explicit consent.
For outbound apps, the platform provides AI agent builders a secure, scalable way to connect AI agents to external tools without having to manually manage and store tokens, scopes and permissions. Developers have a choice of more than 50 out-of-the-box tool integration templates, including support for Gmail, HubSpot Inc., GitHub Inc., Snowflake Inc., Slack Technologies Inc., Notion Labs Inc. and Shopify Inc.
The new platform also provides support for MCP Auth software development kits and APIs to help developers build and manage remote MCP servers to secure their systems with robust authorization controls, as well as extend the MCP servers’ functionality by connecting them with multiple OAuth-based services.
“As AI systems make our lives easier, we must ensure the lives of developers building AI don’t become harder,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Slavik Markovich. “The Agentic Identity Hub provides a set of tools to help de

Pierluigi Paganini
April 22, 2025
Abilene, Texas, shut down systems after a cyberattack caused server issues. IT staff and experts are investigating the security incident.
Abilene, Texas, shut down systems after a cyberattack caused server issues. The incident occurred on April 18, 2025, emergency services remained operational, and no financial irregularities were found.
“On April 18, 2025, City officials received reports of unresponsive servers within our internal network and immediately began executing our incident response plan and disconnecting affected and critical assets to secure our systems.” reads the
notice
of security incident published by the company. “We also launched an investigation and engaged industry-leading cybersecurity experts to determine the nature and scope of the incident and notified relevant authorities.”
The IT department worked tirelessly to restore services, however, some of the impacted systems remain offline as a precaution, but emergency services continue. The experts who are investigating the incident are not aware of financial irregularities following the event.
Card systems at government offices are down, so only cash, checks, or online card payments are accepted. The city announced that it won’t shut off utilities for late payments.
“Water utilities customers are still able to pay their Municipal Services Statements. While systems and telephones are being brought back online, you may experience a slower than normal response to service requests.  We are reviewing email requests and will respond as quickly as possible.” continues the notice. “Due to system issues, we will not shut off past-due accounts. “
The IT team continues to monitor for unusual activity, City officials shared emergency contacts and announced that the full recovery will take time.
In May 2023, the IT systems at the City of Dallas, Texas,
were targeted
by a ransomware attack. To prevent the threat from spreading within the network, the City has shut down the impacted IT systems.
The City confirmed the security incident and worked to recover from the ransomware attack that impacted its services, including the police department.
The
Royal ransomware
group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Other government organizations have suffered ransomware attacks in the past, including
Dallas County
and
Wichita County

April 22, 2025
Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warns of hundreds of millions in unauthorized trades linked to hacked brokerage accounts.
Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) reported that the damage caused by unauthorized access to and transactions on internet trading services is increasing.
“There has been a sharp increase in the number of cases of unauthorized access and unauthorized trading (trading by third parties) on Internet trading services using stolen customer information (login IDs, passwords, etc.) from fake websites (phishing sites) disguised as websites of real securities companies.” reads the
FSA’s alert

FSA warns that cases of unauthorized trading via stolen login data from phishing sites mimicking real securities firms are sharply increasing on online trading platforms.
Below are some data provided by the agency that reflect only currently known cases of unauthorized access and fraudulent trading, however, more undiscovered incidents may exist.

Typically, attackers hijack victim accounts, sell held stocks, and use the proceeds to buy assets like Chinese stocks, which remain in the account post-attack. Reported sales and purchase amounts represent total transaction volumes, not customer losses.
To avoid falling victim to unauthorized trading caused by stolen login credentials, users should follow key precautions: never click links in emails or SMS, always access brokerage sites via pre-saved bookmarks, and enable security features like multi-factor authentication and login notifications. Avoid password reuse, choose complex passwords, and check account activity often. If you suspect fraud, change passwords and contact your brokerage immediately. Keeping devices updated and using reliable antivirus software also helps prevent malware-related data theft.

Two deals stood out during the Q1 wave of consolidation in the ad tech and martech landscape, with activity from agency holding companies piquing interest: Publicis Groupe bought Lotame, while WPP acquired InfoSum.
These deals were notable as they represented holding companies writing big checks for ad tech or martech assets — let’s put the pending InterPublic Group (
read Acxiom
) merger with Omnicom to one side for now — rare occurrences in recent years, compared to similar M&A in the 2010s.

In both cases, the Madison Avenue stalwarts bought close bedfellows (see below), in quick succession. As one source, who requested anonymity as they were not cleared to speak with the press, said, “You usually see holdcos [sic] copy holdcos with acquisitions.”
Lotame was already Publicis’ data partner
in Europe and APAC, plus it enhances the holdco’s ID graph by 1.6 billion
The relationship between WPP and InfoSum’s exec teams
is well noted, with the U.K. holdco now proposing a “federated” vision compared to rivals
Despite Digiday’s inquiries, the official transaction amounts were not publicly disclosed. However, separate sources independently claimed both transactions represented exit amounts considerably below their respective earlier valuations. The source, who has extensive experience working for holding company agencies, told Digiday the successive purchases represented “another four to five years of the narrative they just bought.”
Meanwhile, several sources went on to elaborate how the deals represent the evolution of data clean rooms — itself a loose term to characterize platforms that enable the sharing of sensitive first-party data — which have to evolve beyond their first iterations as scaling such propositions becomes challenging.

Additionally, they raise questions about how such technologies can replace the traditional holding company value proposition and whether they are best placed within such entities. Before going any fu

Pierluigi Paganini
April 21, 2025
Researchers spotted a new North Korea-linked group Kimsuky ‘s campaign, exploiting a patched Microsoft Remote Desktop Services flaw to gain initial access.
While investigating a security breach, the AhnLab SEcurity intelligence Center (ASEC) researchers discovered a North Korea-linked group
Kimsuky
‘s campaign, tracked as Larva-24005. Attackers exploited an RDP vulnerability to gain initial access to the target systems.
“In some systems, initial access was gained through exploiting the RDP vulnerability (BlueKeep, CVE-2019-0708). While an RDP vulnerability scanner was found in the compromised system, there is no evidence of its actual use.” reads the
report
published by ASEC. “The threat actor also used other means to distribute the malware, such as attaching the same file to emails and exploiting the Microsoft Office Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882)
[1]
.”
Once they gained access to the systems, the threat actors modified the configuration by installing MySpy malware and RDPWrap to maintain remote access.
In the final stage, the attackers deployed KimaLogger or RandomQuery keyloggers to record keystrokes. Experts observed Kimsuky sending phishing emails targeting Korea and Japan from compromised systems.
Since September 2023, the North Korean APT has targeted organizations in South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and several other countries. Their activity includes phishing campaigns against South Korea and Japan and attacks on South Korea’s software, energy, and financial sectors starting in October 2023.
ASEC researchers also published indicators of compromise (IoC) for this campaign.
Kimsuky cyberespionage group
(aka ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee,
Thallium
, Velvet Chollima,
APT43
) was first
spotted
by Kaspersky researchers in 2013. The group works under the control of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) foreign intelligence service. At the end of October 2020, the
US-CERT published a report on Kimusky’s recent activities
that provided information on their TTPs and infrastructure.
The APT group mainly targets think tanks and organizations in South Korea, other victims were in the United States, Europe, and Russia.
In February, ASEC researchers observed North Korea’s
Kimsuky
APT group conducting spear-phishing attacks to deliver forceCopy info-stealer malware.
The state-sponsored hackers sent spear-phishing messages to distribute malicious *.LNK shortcut files, disguised as Office documents. When opened, they execute PowerShell or Mshta to download malware like
PebbleDash
and RDP Wrapper, to control the infected systems.
The attackers use a custom-built
RDP Wrapper
to enable remote desktop access, likely modifying export functions to evade detection.
The researchers noticed that the threat actors also install proxy malware to achieve external access to the infected systems that are located in a p

#ProBlue: How Wolverines in the NHL fared in 2024-25 - Part 2

Previously:
Part 1
We're back here for Part 2 of our series on how all the Wolverines in the NHL did this season. Last article we covered most of the established NHL players, while today we will cover the last remaining established NHLers, most of whom skew younger, before looking at guys who played a few NHL games this year but were mostly in the minors, one retiree, and then a quick rundown on past players now in the minor leagues for good/playing around the world.
The Younger Role Players
For all the people screaming WHAT ABOUT FRANK NAZAR? in the comments of the last piece, he will be in this section below. It's the same bucket as where I left off the previous piece but there were too many role players to put in that piece. So I broke it up, with the more established players in the previous piece and the younger ones here below. These are are players that haven't yet established themselves as top of the lineup guys but could be on the way (or are going to be career bottom of the lineup players):
Mackie Samoskevich, LW, Florida Panthers:
Samo had one of the best years relative to expectations of anyone in this year's update. He was placed onto the roster of the defending Stanley Cup Champions in part due to his inexpensive rookie contract and was asked to play down in the lineup, providing depth offense. There were bumps as you'd expect with a rookie but by mid-season he began to find his footing. After the Panthers suffered a slew of injuries to top players like Matthew Tkachuk, Samoskevich had positioned himself well to get a promotion and the chance to play with more skilled players.
From the start of February on, Samo saw his ice time tick way up to over 16 minutes per night and he provided Florida with eight goals and 15 points in 25 games, with decent metrics at both ends. Now that Florida is healthy to the playoffs, Samo slides back down to the bottom six/PP2 where his presence is a reason why the Panthers could repeat as the champs: when Mackie Samoskevich is your 9th or 10th best forward, you're cooking. I'm not sure Samoskevich is going to be a star in the NHL, but I saw enough this year to think Florida made another good draft decision in picking him and that he will carve out a nice career as a scoring line winger.
Frank Nazar, C, Chicago Blackhawks:
If you wanna talk about risers, or guys that exceeded expectations, let's talk about Frank Nazar. After spending the first half of the season in the AHL, Nazar got a mid-season call-up and dazzled over the second half of the year, with a particularly strong close. Chicago had a horrific team this year and the vibes were mostly terrible, but Nazar's presence helped brighte

Pierluigi Paganini
April 25, 2025
Researchers identified a new malware, named DslogdRAT, deployed after exploiting a now-patched flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS).
JPCERT/CC researchers reported that a new malware, dubbed DslogdRAT, and a web shell were deployed by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability during attacks on Japanese organizations in December 2024.
The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-0282
(CVSS score: 9.0), is a stack-based buffer overflow that impacts Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.5, Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways before version 22.7R2.3.
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the flaw to achieve remote code execution. A local authenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability to escalate privileges.
In January, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
the flaw
CVE-2025-0282
(CVSS score: 9.0) to its
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
.
In March 2025, Microsoft
warned
that China-backed APT
Silk Typhoon
linked to US Treasury hack, is now targeting global IT supply chains, using IT firms to spy and move laterally. The APT group exploited the zero-day in January 2025 attacks.
JPCERT/CC now states that attackers used a Perl-based CGI web shell that checked for a specific DSAUTOKEN cookie value and, if matched, executed arbitrary commands via the
system
function—likely used to run DslogdRAT malware.
“This Perl script is executed as a CGI and retrieves the Cookie header from incoming HTTP requests. If the value of
DSAUTOKEN=
matches
af95380019083db5
, the script uses the system function to execute an arbitrary command specified in the request parameter
data
.”reads the
report
published by JPCERT/CC. “It is considered that attackers accessed this simple web shell to execute commands to run malware such as DslogdRAT, which is discussed in the next section.”
DslogdRAT spawns two child processes: one stays idle in a loop, while the second handles core functions like C2 communication and command execution via the pthread library.
“Upon execution, the main process of DslogdRAT creates a first child process and then terminates itself. The child process then decodes the configuration data and creates a second child process.” continues the report. “The first child process enters a loop routine including sleep intervals, and thus it never gets terminated. The second child process contains DslogdRAT core functionality, which includes the following:
Create a worker thread and pass socket information for communication”
Initiate communication with the C2 server based on configuration data
DslogdRAT’s configuration is XOR-encoded and hardcoded, the researchers noticed that it is set to operate only from 8 AM to 8 PM to blend in with normal business activity and evade detection.
DslogdRAT uses socket connections with simple XOR encoding for C2 communication. In its initial exchan

April 25, 2025
Researchers identified a new malware, named DslogdRAT, deployed after exploiting a now-patched flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure (ICS).
JPCERT/CC researchers reported that a new malware, dubbed DslogdRAT, and a web shell were deployed by exploiting a zero-day vulnerability during attacks on Japanese organizations in December 2024.
The vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-0282
(CVSS score: 9.0), is a stack-based buffer overflow that impacts Ivanti Connect Secure before version 22.7R2.5, Ivanti Policy Secure before version 22.7R1.2, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways before version 22.7R2.3.
An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the flaw to achieve remote code execution. A local authenticated attacker can trigger the vulnerability to escalate privileges.
In January, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)
added
the flaw
CVE-2025-0282
(CVSS score: 9.0) to its
Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog
.
In March 2025, Microsoft
warned
that China-backed APT
Silk Typhoon
linked to US Treasury hack, is now targeting global IT supply chains, using IT firms to spy and move laterally. The APT group exploited the zero-day in January 2025 attacks.
JPCERT/CC now states that attackers used a Perl-based CGI web shell that checked for a specific DSAUTOKEN cookie value and, if matched, executed arbitrary commands via the
system
function—likely used to run DslogdRAT malware.
“This Perl script is executed as a CGI and retrieves the Cookie header from incoming HTTP requests. If the value of
DSAUTOKEN=
matches
af95380019083db5
, the script uses the system function to execute an arbitrary command specified in the request parameter
data
.”reads the
report
published by JPCERT/CC. “It is considered that attackers accessed this simple web shell to execute commands to run malware such as DslogdRAT, which is discussed in the next section.”
DslogdRAT spawns two child processes: one stays idle in a loop, while the second handles core functions like C2 communication and command execution via the pthread library.
“Upon execution, the main process of DslogdRAT creates a first child process and then terminates itself. The child process then decodes the configuration data and creates a second child process.” continues the report. “The first child process enters a loop routine including sleep intervals, and thus it never gets terminated. The second child process contains DslogdRAT core functionality, which includes the following:
Create a worker thread and pass socket information for communication”
Initiate communication with the C2 server based on configuration data
DslogdRAT’s configuration is XOR-encoded and hardcoded, the researchers noticed that it is set to operate only from 8 AM to 8 PM to blend in with normal business activity and evade detection.
DslogdRAT uses socket connections with simple XOR encoding for C2 communication. In its initial exchan

The car rides on an adjustable air suspension along with a narrowed front axle beam, dropped spindles, lowered rear spring plates, disc brakes, and 17″ BRM-style wheels wrapped in Nankang tires. Finished in silver and white over white vinyl and gray tweed upholstery, the car is powered by a 2,110cc air-cooled flat-four equipped with dual 40mm EMPI HPMX carburetors, a PerTronix Flame-Thrower distributor, a serpentine belt conversion, and a Vintage Speed exhaust system with J-tubes. Additional details include a roof rack, a safari-style windshield, pop-out rear quarter windows, Porsche-style headlight lenses, HID headlamps, a bamboo parcel shelf, front lap belts, a roller accelerator pedal, a retro-style radio, and a Speedhut GPS speedometer. Acquired by the seller in 2020, this modified Beetle is now offered at no reserve with British Columbia registration.
The body was removed from the pan, repairs were performed, and replacement fenders were fitted before it was refinished in silver and white as part of the refurnishment in 2015. The rear bumper has been trimmed for clearance, and additional exterior details include a roof rack, a safari-style windshield, pop-out rear quarter windows, Porsche-style headlight lenses, HID headlamps, and Hella “snowflake” taillight lenses.
The 17″ BRM-style wheels are mounted with 205/40 Nankang Noble Sport NS-20 tires. The car has been fitted with four-wheel disc brakes, a narrowed front axle beam, drop spindles, and lowered rear spring plates in addition to an adjustable air suspension system linked with an air compressor mounted on the frame head plate, a tank beneath the rear seat, and switches below the dashboard.
Inside, the front bucket seats, rear bench, and door panels have been reupholstered in white vinyl with gray tweed inserts. Additional interior elements include a bamboo parcel shelf, front lap belts, a roller accelerator pedal, a retro-style radio, and EMPI door sill guards.
Instrumentation includes a 200-mph Speedhut GPS speedometer with an inset tachometer and a digital odometer that shows 436 miles, all of which were added under current ownership. True mileage is unknown.

A zero-day in SAP NetWeaver is potentially being exploited, putting thousands of internet-facing applications at risk.
Researchers warn that a zero-day vulnerability, tracked as
CVE-2025-31324
(CVSS score of 10/10), in SAP NetWeaver is potentially being exploited. Thousands of internet-facing applications are potentially at risk.
The flaw in SAP NetWeaver Visual Composer Metadata Uploader stems from a lack of proper authorization checks. This means that unauthenticated attackers, those without valid credentials, can exploit it to upload malicious executable files to the system.
Once uploaded, these files can be executed on the host system, potentially leading to a full compromise of the targeted SAP environment. SAP addressed the flaw with the release of the
April 2025 Security Patch Day
.
Researchers from ReliaQuest discovered the vulnerability while investigating multiple attacks, some of which led to the compromise of fully patched systems.
“On April 22, 2025, ReliaQuest published an investigation into exploitation activity targeting SAP NetWeaver systems, uncovering a critical vulnerability later identified by SAP as “CVE-2025-31324″ with a severity score of 10.” reads the
report
published by ReliaQuest. “Initially suspected as a remote file inclusion issue, it was confirmed to be an unrestricted file upload vulnerability, and SAP subsequently released a patch to address it, which we strongly recommend applying.”
The researchers pointed out that SAP systems are high-value targets for attackers due to their use by governments and enterprises. ReliaQuest reported the critical vulnerability to SAP, which led to a patch release. Before public disclosure, ReliaQuest deployed detection mechanisms and enhanced threat visibility to protect customers.
Attackers exploited the Metadata Uploader to upload malicious JSP webshells using crafted POST requests, then executed them with GET requests to gain full control of the target systems. All webshells were deployed in the same root directory, had similar capabilities, and reused code from a public GitHub RCE project.
“The vulnerability involved in these cases lies in the
/developmentserver/metadatauploader
endpoint, a feature designed to handle metadata files for application development and configuration in SAP applications within the NetWeaver environment. In theory, it’s supposed to streamline the transfer and processing of files like configuration data or serialized objects. But in the incidents we investigated, attackers found a way to exploit it.” continues the report. “Via carefully crafted POST requests, the attackers uploaded malicious JSP webshell files and wrote them to the
j2ee/cluster/apps/sap.com/irj/servletjsp/irj/root/
directory. Once there, these files could be executed remotely via simple GET requests, giving attackers full control and turning this endpoint into a launchpad for exploit

TCS is looking for people with skills in areas across My SQL DBA, Azure SME, IBM DB2, AWS SME, Oracle DBA, and DB2 Designer.
According to an internal email, the company is looking for experienced people who have done a minimum of 15 years of full-time education. They must not have a gap of more than two years between education and employment.
The latest hiring round comes just four weeks after a similar exercise by the software giant, which held walk-in interviews for tech workers in five cities on March 22.
In the last round, it hired people with three to six years of experience for diverse positions including Automation Tester (Selenium, Cucumber), Java Developers (Spring Boot and Microservices), Front End Angular Developers, Data Scientist (Python), Data Scientists (SAS/SQL), PowerBI Developer, Snowflake, and Lead web component developers (Angular) for positions in Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Kolkata.

In January this year, TCS had reported a drop in its headcount by about 5,000 people due to attrition, and the company has been able to reverse this in a small measure in the January-March quarter.
The TCS hiring comes alongside software major
Infosys
pursuing a similar hiring exercise.
Infosys
had, last month, put out an internal mail saying it was looking for people across 40+ skill sets, including cloud computing, cyber security, Java Python, DotNet, Android/IoS development, and automation testing. The company was looking for people with a minimum of two years of experience.
Sources, however, said the upcoming recruitment was part of the company’s lateral hiring programme it conducts annually. Infosys had said earlier that it planned to hire 20,000 freshers next fiscal year, without disclosing a break-up between freshers and lateral hires. The Bengaluru-headquartered software giant has about 323,000 employees on its roster.

Leaders worldwide are promoting minimal AI regulation to drive innovation and avoid hindering growth. This strategy empowers businesses to explore new applications without excessive oversight. As AI capabilities evolve rapidly, organizations accelerate adoption to seize the technology’s transformative potential. Yet, this swift progress also brings escalating security challenges. Threat actors leverage AI to launch more sophisticated attacks, amplifying the need for vigilant defenses. As organizations race to harness AI’s potential, they must adopt proactive security measures and adaptive defense strategies to navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape.
The Dark Side Of Innovation: How AI Advancement Is Fueling A Surge In Cyber Threats
Global deregulation fuels rapid AI innovation, sparking an international arms race. Nations, from government-funded labs in China to tech giants in Silicon Valley, are racing to develop advanced AI capabilities to secure a strategic edge.
According to Delinea’s
Cybersecurity and the AI Threat Landscape report,
AI-powered threats surged in 2024. Tactics like AI-generated phishing and deepfake fraud bypassed traditional defenses, while info-stealer malware enabled large-scale breaches, as seen in the Snowflake incident. The growing reliance on machine identities expanded the attack surface, and poor credential rotation left systems exposed. This dual-use nature of AI highlights the delicate balance between progress and security.
The Emergence Of Shadow AI
In this fast-moving environment, organizations face an unintended consequence: shadow AI. This refers to the unsanctioned use of AI tools by teams without approval or oversight from IT or security departments. The easy availability of free or low-cost AI tools exacerbates the issue, allowing teams to bypass traditional procurement channels with built-in compliance controls.
These rogue AI projects address business needs without assessing risks, exposing sensitive data to breaches or compliance violations. Operating outside IT infrastructure, they evade security monitoring, increasing exploitation risk. For regulated industries like finance, healthcare or defense, shadow AI can lead to GDPR and HIPAA violations, resulting in fines, legal consequences and reputational damage.
Enhancing Organizational Resilience
The challenge of shadow AI is not merely technical but also an organizational and cultural issue. In many organizations, the rapid pace of innovation creates a "move fast and break things" mentality. While this can be beneficial in fostering creativity and agility, it also leads to environments whe

Pierluigi Paganini
April 25, 2025
The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group targeted at least six firms in South Korea in a cyber espionage campaign called Operation SyncHole.
Kaspersky researchers reported that the North Korea-linked APT group
Lazarus
targeted at least six firms in South Korea in a cyber espionage campaign tracked as Operation SyncHole.
The campaign has been active since at least November 2024, Lazarus Group is targeting South Korean organizations using
watering hole
tactics and exploiting software vulnerabilities. Targeted organizations are in IT, finance, semiconductors, and the telecom sectors, with likely more compromised.
Kaspersky notified
Korea Internet & Security Agency
(KrCERT/CC), the researchers discovered that threat actor exploited a one-day vulnerability in Innorix Agent for lateral movement.
The attackers used multiple hacking tools and malware, including
ThreatNeedle
, Agamemnon downloader,
wAgent
, SIGNBT, and
COPPERHEDGE
.
“The initial infection was discovered in November of last year when we detected a variant of the ThreatNeedle backdoor, one of the Lazarus group’s flagship malicious tools, used against a South Korean software company. We found that the malware was running in the memory of a legitimate SyncHost.exe process, and was created as a subprocess of Cross EX, legitimate software developed in South Korea.” reads the
report
published by Kaspersky. “This potentially was the starting point for the compromise of further five organizations in South Korea.”
In South Korea, many government and banking websites require users to install specific security software for functions like anti-keylogging and digital signatures. These programs run continuously in the background, making them attractive targets. The North Korea-linked Lazarus Group exploited vulnerabilities in one such program, Cross EX, using it in watering hole attacks aimed specifically at South Korean sectors. The malware injection process originated from Cross EX and was executed with high system privileges, suggesting privilege escalation. The National Cyber Security Center of South Korea had already issued advisories [

] on these risks in 2023, also collaborating with the UK on joint warnings. The incidents, all involving the same execution pattern and version of Cross EX, occurred between November 2024 and February 2025, confirming a coordinated and targeted campaign.
The Lazarus group exploited vulnerabilities in South Korean software, notably Innorix Agent and Cross EX, to infiltrate systems, spread malware, and streamline attacks. Infections began via compromised media sites, leading to ThreatNeedle malware deployment through malicious redirects and privilege escalation.
The Lazarus group’s Operation SyncHole is composed of two phases: initially using ThreatNeedle and wAgent malware, then shifting to SIGNBT and COPPERHEDGE. The researchers reported that after early detectio

Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI
–
We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display.
In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world.
Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves.
In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course.

Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here?
In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software.

The Hacker News
Secrets Management / DevOps
When we talk about identity in cybersecurity, most people think of usernames, passwords, and the occasional MFA prompt. But lurking beneath the surface is a growing threat that does not involve human credentials at all, as we witness the exponential growth of Non-Human Identities (NHIs).
At the top of mind when NHIs are mentioned, most security teams immediately think of
Service Accounts
. But NHIs go far beyond that. You've got
Service Principals
,
Snowflake Roles
,
IAM Roles
, and platform-specific constructs from AWS, Azure, GCP, and more. The truth is, NHIs can vary just as widely as the services and environments in your modern tech stack, and managing them means understanding this diversity.
The real danger lies in how these identities authenticate.
Secrets: The Currency of Machines
Non-Human Identities, for the most part, authenticate using
secrets
: API keys, tokens, certificates, and other credentials that grant access to systems, data, and critical infrastructure. These secrets are what attackers want most. And shockingly, most companies have no idea how many secrets they have, where they're stored, or who is using them.
The
State of Secrets Sprawl 2025
revealed two jaw-dropping stats:
23.7 million
new secrets were leaked on public GitHub in 2024 alone
And
70%
of the secrets leaked in 2022 are
still valid today
Why is this happening?
A part of the story is that
there's no MFA for machines
. No verification prompt. When a developer creates a token, they often grant it wider access than needed, just to make sure things work.
Expiration dates? Optional. Some secrets are created with 50-year validity windows. Why? Because teams don't want the app to break next year. They choose speed over security.
This creates a massive blast radius. If one of those secrets leaks, it can unlock everything from production databases to cloud resources, without triggering any alerts.
Detecting compromised NHIs is much harder than with humans. A login from Tokyo at 2 am might raise red flags for a person, but machines talk to each other 24/7 from all over the world.
Malicious activity blends right in
.
Many of these secrets act like invisible backdoors, enabling lateral movement, supply chain attacks, and undetected breaches.
The Toyota incident
is a perfect example — one leaked secret can take down a global system.
This is why
attackers love NHIs and their secrets
. The permissions are too often high, the visibility is commonly low, and the consequences can be huge.
The Rise of the Machines (and Their Secrets)
The shift to cloud-native, microservices-heavy environments has introduced
thousands
of NHIs per organization. NHIs now outnumber human identities from
50:1 to a 100:1
ratio, and this is only expected to increase. These digital workers connect services, automate tasks, and drive AI pipelines — and every single one of them needs secrets to functi

DaVita is prioritizing continuity of in-patient dialysis care following a cyberattack. They’ve activated contingency plans and manual procedures where necessary and are working to securely restore affected systems.
“On April 12, 2025, DaVita became aware of a ransomware incident affecting and encrypting certain on-premises systems. We activated our incident response protocols and implemented containment measures, including proactively disconnecting parts of the network.
External cybersecurity experts are assisting with our response, remediation and recovery efforts, and we are in the process of rebuilding and restoring encrypted systems and bringing them back online in a secure manner.”
states the company
. “While the incident has resulted in disruption to our internal operations, we continue to have contingency plans and manual processes in place where needed with a focus on continuity of patient care.”
The
Interlock ransomware
gang has claimed responsibility for the cyberattack on DaVita.
The group claimed the theft of 1510 GB of sensitive data, including patient records, insurance, and financial information. Interlock leaked DaVita’s alleged stolen files on their data leak site.

Snowflake Snowpark Python and Snowpark pandas APIs
The Snowpark library provides intuitive APIs for querying and processing data in a data pipeline.
Using this library, you can build applications that process data in Snowflake without having to move data to the system where your application code runs.

Samples
Getting started
Have your Snowflake account ready
If you don't have a Snowflake account yet, you can
sign up for a 30-day free trial account
.
Create a Python virtual environment
You can use
miniconda
,
anaconda
, or
virtualenv
to create a Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 virtual environment.
For Snowpark pandas, only Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 is supported.
To have the best experience when using it with UDFs,
creating a local conda environment with the Snowflake channel
is recommended.
Install the library to the Python virtual environment
pip
install
snowflake-snowpark-python
To use the
Snowpark pandas API
, you can optionally install the following, which installs
modin
in the same environment. The Snowpark pandas API provides a familiar interface for pandas users to query and process data directly in Snowflake.
pip
install
"snowflake-snowpark-python[modin]"
Create a session and use the Snowpark Python API
from
snowflake.snowpark
import

Snowflake Snowpark Python and Snowpark pandas APIs
The Snowpark library provides intuitive APIs for querying and processing data in a data pipeline.
Using this library, you can build applications that process data in Snowflake without having to move data to the system where your application code runs.

Samples
Getting started
Have your Snowflake account ready
If you don't have a Snowflake account yet, you can
sign up for a 30-day free trial account
.
Create a Python virtual environment
You can use
miniconda
,
anaconda
, or
virtualenv
to create a Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 or 3.12 virtual environment.
For Snowpark pandas, only Python 3.9, 3.10, or 3.11 is supported.
To have the best experience when using it with UDFs,
creating a local conda environment with the Snowflake channel
is recommended.
Install the library to the Python virtual environment
pip
install
snowflake-snowpark-python
To use the
Snowpark pandas API
, you can optionally install the following, which installs
modin
in the same environment. The Snowpark pandas API provides a familiar interface for pandas users to query and process data directly in Snowflake.
pip
install
"snowflake-snowpark-python[modin]"
Create a session and use the Snowpark Python API

Pierluigi Paganini
April 24, 2025
Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) announced that threat actors stole the personal data of 5.5 million patients in a cyberattack.
Yale New Haven Health (YNHHS) disclosed a data breach that exposed personal information of 5.5 million patients following a cyberattack that occurred earlier this month.
Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS) is a nonprofit healthcare network headquartered in New Haven, Connecticut. It stands as the largest healthcare system in the state, encompassing a comprehensive array of medical services and facilities.​
The system operates more than 360 locations across Connecticut, southeastern New York, and Rhode Island, managing over 2,400 beds and employing a vast network of healthcare professionals. The healthcare network employs about 30,000 health professionals and has an annual revenue of over $5.6 billion.
On March 11, 2025, YNHHS faced a cybersecurity incident affecting IT services. The issue was quickly contained with help from cybersecurity firm Mandiant. The company
declared
that patient care and medical records remain unaffected, though some internet and app access issues persist as part of recovery efforts. The organization also notified authorities.
YNHHS disclosed the data breach on April 11, 2025, it added that threat actors stole sensitive patient information. The stolen data varies by patient and includes the following info:
Full name
Date of birth
Home address
Telephone number
Email address
Race/ethnicity
Social Security number (SSN)
Patient type
Medical record number
It was clarified that the exposure did not include financial information, medical records, or treatment details.
“On March 8, 2025, we identified unusual activity affecting our Information Technology (IT) systems. We immediately took steps to contain the incident and began an investigation, which included assistance from external cybersecurity experts. We also reported the incident to law enforcement. The investigation determined that an unauthorized third-party gained access to our network and, on March 8, 2025, obtained copies of certain data.” reads the
Notice of Data Security Incident
published by the YNHHS. “At no point did this incident impact our ability to provide patient care.”
Starting April 14, YNHHS is mailing letters to patients affected by a data breach. While no misuse of data has been reported, free credit monitoring is offered to those whose Social Security numbers were involved. The organizations set up a dedicated call center at 1-855-549-2678 for questions.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services breach portal
, the incident impacted 5,556,702 individuals.
The organization did not disclose technical details about the attack, however, at this time, no ransomware group has taken responsibility for the attack.

The Three-Body Problem has been plaguing astronomers for 350 years. Predicting the orbital dynamics of two bodies is simple: You put a dot in the gravitational center between the two bodies, and draw circles based on their current masses and accelerations. Add a third body however and things get exponentially more complicated, introducing cascading levels of formulae as small factors interact with each other at non-repeatable angles.
This describes trying to project Elijah Dotson after he played his senior year with a generational prospect. Dotson was fairly unknown for much of the cycle, playing his first three seasons at historically strong but recently meh UofD Jesuit in Detroit—
the first two exclusively at receiver, the third at safety
with
plans to move him to cornerback
($)—before Dotson transferred to Belleville. The transfer brought him deep into the enormous gravity of Bryce Underwood, turning one of 2025's least scouted talents into one of its most late in the cycle. Scouts drawn to Belleville for Underwood (who hardly needed more scouting by that point) found Dotson a much more interesting evaluation. Michigan fans showing up to seal the deal were not shy about their desire for the rising #2 prospect in the state.
Calculating Dotson's trajectory thus requires going back to recreate the conditions when he committed to Pat Narduzzi and Archie Collins.
Clinkscale had built a relationship

Dotson was silently committed to Pitt by early 2024, and officially by late May. Michigan had Ivan Taylor, Kainoa Winston and Jordan Young on the hook.
Then came the transfer, a great 7v7 season, a move to safety, the first of several ratings bumps, and attempts by several schools to flip him. Dotson was trending to Michigan by November and committed a week before Underwood. At the time Young had just pledged to Clemson, and a lot of people assumed Dotson was the heroin-laced carrot to draw Bryce. A sense that Michigan didn't know what position they wante

2025 spring game
WTKA Roundtable 4/24/2025: Take Your Kid to Work Day
Seth
April 24th, 2025 at 10:44 AM
Special guest: Everybody wave hi to Mira.
Things Discussed:
Spring game: Craig watched the line, wasn't that impressed.
Bryce was throwing flat; overthrowing McCulley is a sin. There's a guy across the aisle who's already mad. Seth thinks when the threw that small window past a dropping DE was good; Brian thought he didn't see the drop.
Jadyn Davis: Didn't look that polished but much improved.
Mikey Keene? Brian thinks he's not a P4 quarterback.
Receivers? If you go in the portal you can get a bunch of CJ Charlestons at this point. McCulley had the one contested ball and did the George Costanza.
Keeps the expectations for Bryce in context, because Trevor Lawrence had NFL wideouts to throw at as a freshman. Want guys to step up: Marsh, Browder: turn around and context that. Seth: comp is what Nebraska got out of Raiola last year. Need the running game to be the engine of the offense. Get to functional.
Hey Sam, how many targets is Jalen Hoffman getting?
Are they going to do zone reads for Bryce?
OL: Sprague up, Link down—if they're not naming him the starter now maybe he needs to move inside. Sam thinks Frazier can get healthy and get back his agility. Seth thinks they're gonna survive until Babalola is ready, ETA midseason.
Break: Sam talks about his colon (I left this out of the podcast version).
Defense: Tackles go six deep with big dudes. With them it's more about who they're going against.
Linebacker: We are RICH. Seth thinks we have two guys who are better than the top six guys in the Draft, AND Rolder made it through spring without getting hurt. Barham has many uses, Sam thinks he's going to be an All-American. Sullivan can do Barham things.
Big Nickel Mason Curtis: think this is a thing.
Seth thinks Efobi looked like he was moving them.
Dom Nichols: not surprised that a guy who played a lot as a true freshman is getting talk as DE#3.
Who's got bend? Sam says Barham is #1. Seth wants to see it from Edokpayi.

2025 spring game
WTKA Roundtable 4/24/2025: Take Your Kid to Work Day
Seth
April 24th, 2025 at 10:44 AM
Special guest: Everybody wave hi to Mira.
Things Discussed:
Spring game: Craig watched the line, wasn't that impressed.
Bryce was throwing flat; overthrowing McCulley is a sin. There's a guy across the aisle who's already mad. Seth thinks when the threw that small window past a dropping DE was good; Brian thought he didn't see the drop.
Jadyn Davis: Didn't look that polished but much improved.
Mikey Keene? Brian thinks he's not a P4 quarterback.
Receivers? If you go in the portal you can get a bunch of CJ Charlestons at this point. McCulley had the one contested ball and did the George Costanza.
Keeps the expectations for Bryce in context, because Trevor Lawrence had NFL wideouts to throw at as a freshman. Want guys to step up: Marsh, Browder: turn around and context that. Seth: comp is what Nebraska got out of Raiola last year. Need the running game to be the engine of the offense. Get to functional.

Push Security raises $30M to expand browser-based identity threat detection
by
Duncan Riley
SHARE
Identity security company
Push Security Ltd.
announced today that it has raised $30 million in new funding to accelerate growth, fuel innovation and global expansion.
Founded in 2020, Push Security specializes in preventing identity-based attacks through a browser-based Identity Threat Detection and Response platform. The company offers a lightweight browser agent that monitors and protects workforce identities in real time to allow organizations to detect and block threats such as phishing, credential stuffing and session hijacking directly within the browser.
Push Security says its browser-based identity security platform detects and intercepts identity attacks before they escalate by securing identities in the browser and, in doing so, closing security gaps left by traditional identity and security solutions. The platform also identifies vulnerabilities like stolen credentials, missing multi-factor authentication controls and non-single sign-on identities, allowing security teams to act proactively to close identity security gaps and stop breaches before they happen.
“Compromised identities are now the prized target for attackers,” said Chief Executive Adam Bateman. “Stolen credentials and phishing remain the top two causes of reported breaches and high-profile incidents, like the
Snowflake breach
last summer, are showing us the massive impact they can have.”
The company’s solution turns employees’ browsers into a powerful telemetry source and control point for stopping identity attacks. The browser extension provides visibility into user interactions with cloud applications, analyzing login behaviors and authentication methods to identify risky activities. The service detects when employees access unauthorized or unmanaged software-as-a-service applications, allowing security teams to enforce policies and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.​
The platform also offers features, including in-browser prompts and app banners, that guide users toward secure practices. For instance, if an employee attempts to log into an application with a weak password, the system can prompt them to strengthen their credentials.
Push Security says it has seen strong growth, serving customers across various industries, including technology, finance and healthcare. In January 2025, Push’s customer base grew 380% year-over-year, off an undisclosed base, and its platform is now deployed on more than 1.5 million endpoints globally.
The Series B funding round was led by Redpoint Ventures, with Datadog Ventures also participating.
“In conversations with CISOs, it is clear that the new critical security perimeter is the browser,” said Erica Brescia, managing director at Redpoint Ventures. “With over 80% of cyberattacks being identity-related, Push is uniquely positioned to protect organizations.”
The new funding takes the amount raise

Transcript
Mao: My name is George. I am currently a Senior Distinguished Engineer at Capital One. I lead a lot of our AWS serverless technology implementations. I'm responsible for helping our teams implement best practices and everything we do on AWS. Before I joined Capital One, I was the tech leader at AWS for serverless computing, so I spent a lot of time, basically since the beginning of 2015, where serverless was first created at Amazon.
Capital One is one of the largest banks in the United States. We're generally somewhere at 10 or 11 in terms of ranking. We're not that big internationally. We do have a pretty good presence in the UK, but that's about it. What's unique about us is we're mostly structured like a tech organization, so we have about 9,000 software engineers. In 2020, we completed our all-in migration into AWS. As far as I know, I think we're one of the only major banks in the world that has ever done an all-in like this. Now what we're trying to do is modernize our entire tech stack running in the cloud. What that means is becoming more cloud-native, taking advantage of all of the AWS managed services, and then becoming more efficient in the cloud.
Outline
This is what we're going to talk about. I'll cover why we decided to make this journey. In chapter 2, we'll talk about some of the lessons that we've learned, and I'll share with you so that you might not run into some of the trouble that we ran into. Then we'll go through a bunch of best practices that you can take home and implement in your organizations.

Pierluigi Paganini
April 24, 2025
Crooks exploit the death of Pope Francis, using public curiosity and emotion to launch scams and spread malware, an old tactic during global events.
After Pope Francis’ death, cybercriminals launched scams and malware attacks, exploiting public curiosity, grief, and confusion.
Cybercriminals are ready to exploit any event of global interest, it has already happened in the past during events like
Queen Elizabeth II’s death
or the
COVID-19
pandemic. Check Point Research calls this trend “cyber threat opportunism,” noting similar spikes during COVID-19, when Google saw 18M+ daily virus-related scam emails.
These emotionally charged moments are fertile ground for digital exploitation. The emotional vulnerability of users makes them prime targets for attackers seeking clicks, personal data, or financial information.
The death of Pope Francis highlights how cybercriminals exploit any event for malicious gain. Strong security practices and awareness are crucial defenses against such risks.
Disinformation as a Gateway
One of the most dangerous criminal practices associated with these events is
disinformation
. Fake news spreads like wildfire on platforms such as Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram.
AI-generated
images and videos fuel conspiracy theories, some claim Pope Francis is still alive, and others sensationalize the circumstances of his death.
Source CheckPoint A fake image generated by artificial intelligence, originally spread in February 2025, is reappearing on various websites and social media posts linking to supposed news sites.
These posts, designed to draw clicks and shares, often contain embedded links that redirect users to fraudulent websites.
CheckPoint found a scam where a fake news link led to a bogus Google gift card page. It tricked users into giving up personal info, including payment data.
Hidden Malware and Data Harvesting
Some malicious sites run hidden scripts that silently gather device names, OS, geolocation, and more data later sold on the
dark web
or used for phishing attack
Threat actors used malware to steal login credentials, financial information, and personal files. Experts warn that even seemingly harmless browsing habits can expose you to these risks if you’re not cautious about the websites you visit.
The SEO Poisoning Trap
Cybercriminals use
SEO poisoning
to boost malicious sites in search results for trending terms like “Pope Francis death,” tricking users into visiting harmful pages.
When unsuspecting users search for credible updates, they may unknowingly click on these malicious results. Once they do, they’re exposed to malware or credential-harvesting schemes that often look nearly identical to real news websites. This creates a dangerous feedback loop where trust in online information continues to erode.
Why These Campaigns Are Hard to Detect
A key challenge in these attacks is that cybercriminals use new or dormant domains with no malici

Pierluigi Paganini
April 24, 2025
WhatsApp adds Advanced Chat Privacy feature that allows users to block others from sharing chat content outside the app.
WhatsApp announced the availability of a new feature called “Advanced Chat Privacy” for both individual and group chats that enhances content protection. The feature blocks chat exports, auto-media downloads, and the use of messages in AI features, ensuring conversations stay private and within the app.
“Today we’re introducing our latest layer for privacy called “
Advanced Chat Privacy
.” This new setting available in both chats and groups helps prevent others from taking content outside of WhatsApp for when you may want extra privacy.” reads the company’s
announcement
.
“When the setting is on, you can block others from exporting chats, auto-downloading media to their phone, and using messages for AI features. That way everyone in the chat has greater confidence that no one can take what is being said outside the chat.”
Users can enable Advanced Chat Privacy by tapping the chat name and selecting the new option. The company announced that it is rolling out the feature on the latest WhatsApp version, with more features to come.
“WhatsApp groups are increasingly an extension of our real world networks, some of which are far closer than others. We think this feature is best used when talking with groups where you may not know everyone closely but are nevertheless sensitive in nature, like talking about health challenges in a support group or organizing your community about something important to you.” concludes the announcement.
Since October 2024, WhatsApp has launched
Identity Proof Linked Storage
(IPLS), an encrypted system that binds contact lists to user accounts, enabling secure syncing across devices and preventing contact loss during phone changes.

April 24, 2025
A new Android spyware was discovered in a fake Alpine Quest app, reportedly used by Russian soldiers for war zone planning.
Doctor Web researchers uncovered a new spyware, tracked as Android.Spy.1292.origin, targeting Russian military personnel. The malicious code was hidden in a trojanized Alpine Quest app and spread via Russian Android catalogs. The malware steals contacts, geolocation, and file info, it can also download extra modules to exfiltrate stored data when instructed.
“Alpine Quest is topographic software that allows different maps to be used both in online and offline mode. It is popular among athletes, travelers, and hunters but also widely used by Russian military personnel in the Special Military Operation zone—and this is what the malware campaign organizers decided to exploit.” reads the
report
published by Doctor Web. Threat actors embedded
Android.Spy.1292.origin
into one of the older Alpine Quest app versions and distributed the trojanized variant under the guise of a freely available version of Alpine Quest Pro, a program with advanced functionality.”
Threat actors set up a fake Telegram channel to distribute the trojanized Alpine Quest app. They shared a link to download the app from a Russian app catalog and later used the same channel to push a malicious “update.”.”
Android.Spy.1292.origin is embedded within a genuine copy of the Alpine Quest app, making it appear and function like the original, to avoid detection. Each time the app is launched, the trojan silently gathers and transmits data such as the user’s phone number, accounts, contact list, current date, geolocation, stored file details, and the app version to a command-and-control server. Simultaneously, it shares some of this data, such as updated geolocation, directly with the attackers’ Telegram bot whenever the device’s location changes.
Once the trojan gathers file information, attackers can instruct it to download and run extra modules to steal specific data. The threat actors behind the malicious app appear interested in confidential documents shared through Telegram and WhatsApp and the locLog file generated by Alpine Quest. This enables Android.Spy.1292.origin to track user locations and exfiltrate sensitive files. Its modular design also allows it to expand its capabilities and perform a broader range of malicious activities.
“As a result,
Android.Spy.1292.origin
not only allows user locations to be monitored but also confidential files to be hijacked. In addition, its functionality can be expanded via the download of new modules, which allows it to then execute a wider spectrum of malicious tasks.” concludes the report.
The researchers recommend downloading Android apps only from trusted sources like official app stores, avoiding Telegram channels and shady sites, especially those offering free versions of paid apps. Users should also verify app distrib

The car is finished in blue over gray vinyl upholstery and features a four-speed manual transaxle, 15″ steel wheels, Coker Classic whitewall tires, a roof rack, fluted headlight lenses, chrome jackhole covers, chrome blade bumpers, a bamboo parcel shelf, Coco mats, front lap belts, and a Sapphire I AM radio. The car spent time in Oregon before the seller’s 2019 acquisition, and it now shows 35k miles. This Beetle is now offered in South Carolina with a clean Washington state title in the seller’s name.
The car is finished in blue and features a roof rack, fluted headlight lenses, fender-mounted turn signals, ice pick-style door handles, chrome jackhole covers, “snowflake” taillight lenses, dual “pea shooter” exhaust outlets, and chrome blade bumpers. Overrider bracket holes are present in the front apron and rear fenders.
The 15” steel wheels wear chrome VW-stamped hubcaps and are mounted with 165-series Coker Classic whitewall tires. Stopping power is provided by four-wheel drum brakes.
The front bucket seats and rear bench are trimmed in gray vinyl upholstery and are joined by color-coordinated carpeting and door panels. Interior elements include a bamboo parcel shelf, Coco mats, front lap belts, and a Sapphire I AM radio.
The two-spoke steering wheel features a Wolfsburg crest horn button and frames a 90-mph speedometer. The five-digit mechanical odometer shows 35k miles, approximately 1k of which were added under current ownership.
The replacement 1.6L air-cooled flat-four utilizes a European-market AR engine case and has been converted to a 12-volt electrical system.
Power is sent to the rear wheels through a four-speed manual transaxle.

Pierluigi Paganini
April 23, 2025
New malware campaign targets Docker environments using unknown methods to secretly mine cryptocurrency, researchers warn.
Researchers from
Darktrace and Cado Security
have spotted a malware campaign that targets Docker environments with a novel technique to mine cryptocurrency.
The malware campaign targets Docker environments to deploy a malicious node connected to Teneo, a decentralized infrastructure network.
Teneo
allows users to earn rewards (
Teneo Points
) by running Community Nodes that scrape public data from social platforms like Facebook, X, Reddit, and TikTok. These points can be converted to $TENEO tokens. The malware covertly monetizes social media bandwidth via this mechanism.
The attack chain begins with a request to launch a container from Docker Hub, specifically the
kazutod/tene:ten
image.
To analyze the malicious Docker image
kazutod/tene:ten
, researchers used Docker tools to pull and save it as a tar file for easier inspection.
Upon extracting the tar, the experts found the image uses the OCI format, where contents are organized in layers. Each layer is stored as a tar file with accompanying JSON metadata, rather than a traditional file system.
“The Docker image uses the OCI format, which is a little different to a regular file system. Instead of having a static folder of files, the image consists of layers. Indeed, when running the file command over the sha256 directory, each layer is shown as a tar file, along with a JSON metadata file.” reads the
report
published by DarkTrace. “As the detailed layers are not necessary for analysis, a single command can be used to extract all of them into a single directory, recreating what the container file system would look like:”
The researchers analyzed the
ten.py
script included in the malicious Docker image and discovered that it is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of base64 encoding, zlib compression, and string reversal. The script decodes and executes a payload repeatedly, each time generating another encoded string to decode, requiring 63 iterations before the actual malicious code is revealed. The researchers pointed out that despite the complex obfuscation process, the decoding process was easily automated, suggesting the effort was likely meant to deter casual analysis rather than seriously hinder experts.
The malicious script connects to
teneo[.]pro
, however, instead of scraping, the malware sends fake keep-alive pings to earn “Teneo Points” based on activity levels. This tactic allows evading common detection techniques for XMRig-based cryptojacking attacks. The attacker’s DockerHub profile suggests similar abuse of decentralized compute networks. However, due to the closed nature of private tokens like Teneo, it’s unclear how profitable this method is.
The attacker’s DockerHub profile shows a pattern of abuse, with their latest container running a Nexus n

Spring Game Takes: Defense
Brian

Also:
offense
. This one is shorter because the defense holds little mystery until you get beyond the two-deep, and I was almost entirely focused on the QBs.
Defensive Line
This is largely a N/A, as Michigan has the luxury of entering this year with a starting lineup consisting entirely of players with hundreds of snaps at high-end P4 schools. Their top backup, whether it's Damon Payne or Tre Williams, will also fit in that box. Meanwhile heavy rotation made it somewhat difficult for any particular player to stand out. Moore did
make it sound
like there are interior guys moving up into rotation roles:
On the defensive tackle position:
It is super deep. You start with a guy like Rayshaun Benny who's been here and played a lot of football.

Defensive Line
This is largely a N/A, as Michigan has the luxury of entering this year with a starting lineup consisting entirely of players with hundreds of snaps at high-end P4 schools. Their top backup, whether it's Damon Payne or Tre Williams, will also fit in that box. Meanwhile heavy rotation made it somewhat difficult for any particular player to stand out. Moore did

On the defensive tackle position:
It is super deep. You start with a guy like Rayshaun Benny who's been here and played a lot of football.

Let’s be honest, we’re all suckers for over-engineered watches that can handle the crushing pressures of the ocean depths, even if the deepest water they’ll ever see is a hotel swimming pool. As fellow watch enthusiasts who work office jobs by day and play weekend warriors outside of the 9-to-5, we’ve assembled this guide to the best GADA (Go Anywhere, Do Anything) dive watches for everyday wear- the ultimate guide to one of our favorite categories: the beloved desk diver.
While we’ve been fortunate enough to take a few actual dives off the Pacific coast here in LA, our watches spend far more time under shirt cuffs than wetsuit sleeves. But that’s the beauty of a
great dive watch
: it’s built to survive the harshest environments on earth, yet versatile enough to complement your business casual attire on Monday morning.

The watch industry is literally filled with dive watches of all kinds. That’s why, for this guide, we focused on the aforementioned GADA divers. Using our years of knowledge in the space, we looked to our favorite brands, sticking to a sub-$5,000 budget and focusing on models that are more style than utility. Looking at products across all price points in our range, we sourced these watches for testing, getting hands-on with each and every piece, spending days with them on our wrist. We looked at look, feel, comfort, and wrist presence, among other things. Our results are detailed below.

Tudor's Black Bay Pro Gets A Surprisingly Dramatic Facelift With An Opaline Dial
Why I sold my original Black Bay Pro and why this new dial is making me reconsider it.

This year, Tudor has added a new dial to the Black Bay Pro lineup. Since the model's one and only variant was introduced back in 2022, folks have been speculating when the next update would be, especially as the Black Bay 58 GMT was introduced last summer as a significantly thinner option in the family. Would that mean that the MT5652, as a 7.5mm tall GMT caliber, would now be obsolete in light of this new thinner MT5450-U movement?
Alas, the MT5652 is here to stay. We all should have expected as much when, in December, Tudor released the Pelagos FXD GMT with the same movement. So with this new Black Bay Pro, all we get is a new dial — no updated case or caliber. But a new dial can go a long way in invigorating a model while still keeping to the same formula. On paper, this is a very insignificant update. Black dial model gets a new white dial version? A tale as old as time. But I do think that this new Black Bay Pro warrants a closer look because it's making me think about this watch in a new light.
Most specs on this update remain the same. The case is still a reasonable 39mm in diameter with 20mm lugs, while keeping that oft-complained-about thickness of 14.6mm. Granted, while the height is in part due to a very tall and pronounced crystal (even more exaggerated because of the thinner fixed bezel on the Black Bay Pro), the cases of the Black Bay line often draw more criticism due to their slab sides. A simpler, blockier case means less in the way of visual trickery when it comes to making a case optically thinner, as we've seen many other brands do successfully. On the wrist, it is ironically the smaller diameter of the watch that makes it seem taller than it really is. Even with the hefty faux-rivet bracelet with adjustable T-fit clasp, the Black Bay Pro presents as a more top-heavy wearing experience (more on that in a little bit).
Surrounding the tall sapphire crystal is that fixed bezel, which I find very attractively beveled with a contrasting polished finish on the side to give a little bit of glimmer to an otherwise very industrial design. And of course, this all leads to this new opaline (or as everyone would say in the halls of the Palexpo, white) dial. As far as Tudor dials go, this might be one of my favorites. It is refreshing, clean, and legible. Something I absolutely loved about my original black dial variant was the rough texturing of the hands, thankfully staying the same in this version.

Rethink authentication to remove the burden on users
The rise of AI powered threats and non-human identities will push an already strained identity security model over the edge

Attackers exploit human nature, making authentication a prime target. The Snowflake
data breach
is a clear example – hackers used stolen customer credentials, many which lacked multi-factor authentication (MFA), to breach several customer accounts, steal sensitive data and reportedly extort dozens of companies. This incident highlights how one seemingly small, compromised credential can have severe consequences.
Phishing scams, credential stuffing, and account takeovers all succeed because authentication still depends on users making security decisions. But no amount of security training can completely stop people from being tricked into handing over their credentials, downloading malware that steals login information, or reusing passwords that can be easily exploited. The problem isn’t the user; it’s the system that requires them to be the last line of defense.
With agentic AI set to introduce a surge of non-human identities (NHIs) - bringing an added layer of complexity to an already complicated IT environment - enterprises need to rethink authentication, removing users from the process as much, and as soon, as possible.
Identity and access management’s (IAM) evolution: From gatekeeper to open door
The explosion of cloud applications, systems and data has made
identity security
more complex and critical than ever before. Today, the average enterprise manages multiple cloud environments and around
1,000 applications
, creating a highly fragmented landscape, which attackers are actively capitalising on. In fact, IBM’s
2025 Threat Intelligence Index
found that most of the cyber attacks investigated last year were caused by cybercriminals using stolen employee credentials to breach corporate networks.
With AI-driven attacks set to make this problem even worse, identity abuse shows no signs of a slowdown. Large language models (LLMs) can automate spear-phishing campaigns and scrape billions of exposed credentials to fuel automated identity attacks. With AI enabling attackers to scale their tactics, the transition away from credential-based security must become a priority for businesses.
Beyond credentials: Letting technology handle authentication
The future of secure modern authentication requires reducing the user burden from the identity paradigm by moving away from passwords and knowledge-based authentication.
Passwordless authentication, based on the
FIDO
(Fast Identity Online) standard replaces traditional passwords with cryptography keys bound to a user’s account on an application or website. Instead of choosing and remembering a password, users authenticate with biometrics or a hardware-backed credential, this is typically provided by the device (laptop

Datadog sees data observability join DevOps, adds Metaplane
Datadog has customers already bringing data science under DevOps and, with its latest acquisition, aims to create a unified tool set for the newly converged combo.

Digital transformation and AI have some enterprises consolidating data science and DevOps teams, Datadog officials said. The vendor plans to offer them data observability baked into its platform later this year, based on its acquisition of Metaplane.
The data observability startup, founded in Boston in 2019, uses machine learning to automatically alert for issues with data quality and delivery in big data warehouse systems such as
Snowflake
. The two companies share joint customers but declined to say how many. Metaplane competitors in data observability include Acceldata, Monte Carlo and Soda Data.
Metaplane's founder, Kevin Hu, and his engineering team will join Datadog and rewrite the company's software to run on Datadog's observability platform. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Michael Whetten
Datadog chose to acquire Metaplane because it's both willing and able to rewrite its tools to run on Datadog, according to Michael Whetten, vice president of product at Datadog. For now, Metaplane will continue to support existing customers as Metaplane by Datadog, but Whetten said its IP will be ported to the Datadog platform within the year. After that, customers will need to move to Datadog to continue to use Metaplane data observability.
The deal came about because Datadog has already seen some customers bring
DataOps
and DevOps teams together and begin to ask for unified tools in the last year, Whetten said.
"We saw that data engineers and data teams were starting to consolidate budgets under the CTO and the application team," Whetten said in an interview with Informa TechTarget. "There was an indication that these things were moving out of just business intelligence, which is still critical, toward real-time operations at scale."
Kevin Hu
Metaplane also had customers asking it to cover more of the IT infrastructure used for data processing, including
data pipeline
tools such as Kafka, according to Hu.
"Data comes from somewhere -- a system, or input by a human, and unfortunately, Metaplane and the current cohort of data observability customers just don't have that visibility," Hu said. "We're not connected to the Kafka stream. We're not connected to the upstream database or to upstream software systems. So when our customers naturally ask the 'What happened?' question, we just simply don't have an answer."
Ultimately, porting Metaplane into Datadog will add more value for users, he said.
"We don't know exactly how it's going to look or what form it's going to take, but now we have data to answer that question of exactly what happened," Hu said. "And if you're writing software or you're on

After that, customers will need to move to Datadog to continue to use Metaplane data observability.
The deal came about because Datadog has already seen some customers bring
DataOps
and DevOps teams together and begin to ask for unified tools in the last year, Whetten said.
"We saw that data engineers and data teams were starting to consolidate budgets under the CTO and the application team," Whetten said in an interview with Informa TechTarget. "There was an indication that these things were moving out of just business intelligence, which is still critical, toward real-time operations at scale."
Kevin Hu
Metaplane also had customers asking it to cover more of the IT infrastructure used for data processing, including
data pipeline
tools such as Kafka, according to Hu.
"Data comes from somewhere -- a system, or input by a human, and unfortunately, Metaplane and the current cohort of data observability customers just don't have that visibility," Hu said. "We're not connected to the Kafka stream. We're not connected to the upstream database or to upstream software systems. So when our customers naturally ask the 'What happened?' question, we just simply don't have an answer."
Ultimately, porting Metaplane into Datadog will add more value for users, he said.
"We don't know exactly how it's going to look or what form it's going to take, but now we have data to answer that question of exactly what happened," Hu said. "And if you're writing software or you're on

Sarah Palin’s libel loss was her second attempt to claim she had been damaged by a 2017 New York Times editorial that was amended less than 14 hours after it was published. “During the trial, Ms. Palin
told the jury
that the editorial ‘kicked the oomph’ right out of her, damaging her reputation,”
The Times
reported. “She said it had ignited another round of criticism of her years after the map was first distributed.”
Poor widdle snowflake.
The AP
explains the legal case:
Her lawsuit stemmed from an editorial about gun control published after U.S. Rep. Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was wounded in 2017 when a man with a history of anti-GOP activity opened fire on a Congressional baseball team practice in Washington.
In the editorial, the Times wrote that before the 2011 mass shooting in Arizona that severely wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and killed six others, Palin’s political action committee had contributed to an atmosphere of violence by circulating a map of electoral districts that put Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized crosshairs.
The Times corrected the article less than 14 hours after it was published, saying it had “incorrectly stated that a link existed between political rhetoric and the 2011 shooting” and that it had “incorrectly described” the map.
The AP further noted that the Times’ then-editorial page editor “
tearfully apologized
to Palin,” during the trial, “saying he was tormented by the error and worked urgently to correct it after readers complained to the newspaper.”
Personally, I think the editorial pales in comparison to the hideous rhetoric that routinely comes from MAGA world. That includes putting out a map with crosshairs over Democratic districts. Or Palin, herself, accusing Barack Obama of “
palling around with terrorists
,” e.g.
But Palin’s suit is not really about the harm she allegedly suffered from a 14-hour insult from The Times. It’s “widely understood” that the real goal has been to get the case to the Trumpy Supreme Court where Justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas have already “shown an openness to altering U.S. libel law to make it easier to sue media outlets,” Ja’han Jones wrote in an
MSNBC.com
blog post.
“Palin declined to say whether she would appeal the verdict,”
The Times
also reported. “Outside the court after the verdict, Ms. Palin said she was going to ‘go home to a beautiful family’ and ‘get on with life.’

Phishing has declined as a method of initial access in 2024 and is now behind credential theft and vulnerability exploitation, according to Mandiant’s
M-Trends 2025 Report
.
This continues a trend observed over several year, with email phishing falling from 22% to 14% for initial access from 2022 to 2024.
Vulnerability exploitation was the most common method of infiltrating targets in 2024, making up 33% of cases. However, this marks a significant
decline from 38%
in 2023.
The use of stolen credentials for initial access jumped from 10% to 16% from 2023 to 2024, making it the second most common technique.
Proportion of initial access vectors, 2022-24. Source: Mandiant
Mandiant noted that the fall in phishing and rise in stolen credentials is largely due to the growing ability of threat actors to obtain credentials in a variety of ways. This includes:
Purchasing leaked or stolen credentials on underground forums
Mining large data leaks for credentials
Infecting users with keyloggers and infostealers
Another notable initial access trend was insider threats, making up 5% of vectors. The researchers highlighted a surge in fake
North Korean IT worker
campaigns as a major contributor to this trend.

Infostealers Leading to Surge in Stolen Credentials
The report highlighted a
renewed focus by threat actors on infostealers
– malware designed to collect and steal sensitive user data such as credentials, browser data and cookies, email data and cryptocurrency wallets.
Infostealers create unique challenges for organizations as they can collect wide swaths of user data and credentials from a single host. This is unlike techniques such as phishing and credential stuffing, which target credentials for a specific system.
Additionally, when employees or contractors leverage personal devices for work purposes, infostealers can fall outside the scope enterprise security and detection measures.
A major example of the use of infostealers was during the compromise of
multiple Snowflake customers
in a campaign starting in April 2024. Snowflake is a cloud data warehousing platform.
These credentials were primarily obtained from infostealer malware campaigns that infected the work or personal computers of employees and contractors who accessed Snowflake customer instances.
Prominent infostealer variants used last year included Vidar, Resepro, Redline, Raccoon stealer,
Lumma
and Metastealer.
Phishing the Biggest Driver of Cloud Compromises
Despite the overall reduction in email phishing for initial access, this technique was the most common initial infection
vector for cloud environments

This was followed by stolen credentials (35%), SIM swapping (6%) and voice phishing or vishing (6%).

survey by developer security platform Synk

For
Endor Labs
, that opportunity proved alluring enough that it chose to change course somewhat. Endor started off helping companies secure their open source package dependencies — in fact, it even
raised a $70 million Series A round
just two years ago to grow its developer pipeline governance service.
But the startup’s co-founders, Varun Badhwar and Dimitri Stiliadis, saw growing demand elsewhere — spotting and combating vulnerabilities in the growing masses of code that engineers use AI to generate and fine-tune.
Today, Endor runs a platform that, it claims, can not only review code and identify risks, but also recommend “precise” fixes and apply them automatically. The company offers a plug-in for AI-powered programming tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot that scans code as it’s written and flags issues.
The pivot could prove to be a wise choice. On Wednesday, Endor announced that it closed a $93 million Series B round led by DFJ Growth, with participation from Salesforce Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Coatue, Dell Technologies Capital, Section 32, and Citi Ventures.
Badhwar (CEO) said that the round values Endor at “orders of magnitude higher” than its
Series A
valuation. The proceeds will be used to expand Endor’s platform, he added. The Series B brings the startup’s total capital raised to $163 million.
“This new round positions us to continue delivering, even in a tougher macro environment than similar companies faced five to 10 years ago,” Badhwar told TechCrunch. “We raised now because we’re seeing strong momentum — 30x annual recurring revenue growth since our Series A in 2023 — and this lets us double down on delivering outcomes for our customers.”

Several months ago, Endor launched a tool designed to help organizations spot where AI models and services integrate with their codebase, and evaluate the integrations for security flaws. The idea is to provide better oversight as AI programming tools proliferate, said Badhwar.
Endor says it now protects more than 5 million applications and runs over a million scans each week for customers including OpenAI, Rubrik, Peloton, Snowflake, Egnyte, and Dropbox.
“We came out of stealth in October 2022 — right as interest rates spiked — and we’ve seen strong traction ever since,” Badhwar said.
Ramin Sayar, venture partner at DFJ Growth, said his firm invested because Endor found itself at the right place, at the right time.

Pierluigi Paganini
April 23, 2025
The
xrpl.js
Ripple cryptocurrency library was compromised in a supply chain attack aimed at stealing users’ private keys.
Threat actors compromised the Ripple cryptocurrency npm JavaScript library
xrpl.js
to harvest users’ private keys.
xrpl.js
is the recommended library for integrating a JavaScript/TypeScript app with the XRP, it has more than 140.000 weekly downloads. Hundreds of thousands of applications and websites use this package, the package has been
downloaded
over 2.9 million times to date.
On April 21, Aikido Intel detected that the official
xrpl
NPM package was compromised with a backdoor as part of a supply chain attack.
“At 21 Apr, 20:53 GMT+0, our system,
Aikido Intel
started to alert us to five new package version of the
xrpl
package. It is the official SDK for the XRP Ledger, with more than 140.000 weekly downloads.” reads the
report
published by Aikido. “We quickly confirmed the official XPRL (Ripple) NPM package was compromised by sophisticated attackers who put in a backdoor to steal cryptocurrency private keys and gain access to cryptocurrency wallets. “
The researchers investigated the supply chain attack and discovered that five
xrpl
package versions (4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 2.14.2) contained malicious code. The user
'mukulljangid
‘ released all five malware-laced versions of the library starting from 21 Apr, 20:53 GMT+0.
The researchers noticed the presence of a function named checkValidityOfSeed in the code that was used to exfiltrate the stolen information to the domain “0x9c [.] xyz”.
At this time, it is unclear who is behind the attack, however, the experts pointed out that multiple version bumps occurred as attackers refined their methods. Version 4.2.1 removed key configs; 4.2.2 introduced malicious JavaScript. Later versions (4.2.3, 4.2.4) added backdoors in TypeScript, showing the attacker’s evolving tactics to avoid detection and moving from manual code insertion to compiled backdoors.
The problem has been fixed in
versions 4.2.5 and 2.14.3
.
Users of the xrpl.js library are urged to update to versions 4.2.5 or 2.14.3 to mitigate risks from the recent supply chain attack.
The company provided indicators of compromise to check whether users’ systems may have been affected by the malicious versions of the library.

Pierluigi Paganini
April 23, 2025
Cybercriminals leverage NFC fraud against ATMs and POS terminals, stealing money from consumers at scale.
Resecurity (USA) investigated multiple incidents identified in Q1 2025, exceeding several million dollars in damages for one of the top Fortune 100 financial institutions in the United States due to NFC fraud. Stopping cybercriminals operating from China presents significant challenges due to geopolitical, technical, and organizational factors.
Cybersecurity experts identified multiple Chinese cybercriminal groups targeting Google and Apple Wallet customers. Their TTPs center on the abuse of contactless payments and the misuse of the NFC technology to conduct fraud. The analysts from Resecurity’s HUNTER unit
identified
a group on Telegram offering the
Z-NFC tool
for sale to facilitate fraudulent transactions. Another tool, called
King NFC
, was previously marketed on the
Dark Web
as an alternative.
Primarily, the actors use Android-based phones, with numerous cards “loaded” into mobile wallets for further fraud. In one such instance, cybercriminals specifically focused on fraud automation against
Barclays
,
Bank of Scotland
,
Lloyds Banking Group
,
Halifax
,
HSBC
,
Santander
,
Wise
and
Revolut
.
How do those apps work? They all use Host Card Emulation (HCE) to mimic a physical ISO 14443 NFC smart card by registering a service that extends HostApduService. This allows the app to respond to APDU command sequences like a card. APDU (Application Protocol Data Unit) commands are the standardized communication units used between a smart card reader and a smart card. Cybercriminals exploit the same approach by manipulating HCE for malicious purposes to process compromised credit card data via NFC.
Why is NFC-enabled fraud still possible? Traditional payments typically require some Cardholder Verification Method (CVM) such as PIN or signature. For low-value contactless payments below the “Contactless CVM limit,” no CVM is required – the consumer can simply Tap & Go. Unfortunately, cybercriminals actively exploit this issue by executing multiple small transactions while leveraging a high volume of compromised cards.
Besides traditional POS terminals, according to Resecurity, cybercriminals also abuse tap on phone software solutions (called Soft POS) that turns NFC-enabled Android smartphones, tablets and other handheld devices into payment terminals.
Today, it is estimated that
1.9 billion phones
worldwide are NFC-enabled, showcasing its rapid adoption.

From CRM giant to ‘digital labor’ provider: How Salesforce aims to stand above the hype with agentic AI

As more vendors rebrand automation as agents, established giants and startups alike are challenged to show agentic AI delivers real business value — not just hype.
Among the most ambitious is Salesforce, which aims to do for AI what it did for enterprise software.
Last week, Salesforce
highlighted
growth for its Data Cloud and Agentforce platforms, reporting $900 million in annual recurring revenue for fiscal 2025 and 3,000 net-new Agentforce deals in the fourth quarter. The company is pitching these tools as the foundation tapping into what it sees as a potential
$6 trillion “digital labor market”
— which comprises
AI agents
powering marketing, sales, and service workflows.
Agentforce and Data Cloud are the platforms driving Salesforce’s agentic AI strategy. Agentforce, which debuted last fall, enables companies to deploy
autonomous AI agents
. Meanwhile, Data Cloud, its customer data platform, first debuted in 2020 as
Customer 360 Audiences
before evolving through several rebrands before becoming Data Cloud in 2023.
Companies like CaixaBank, Maserati, OpenTable, and Pfizer are already using Agentforce and Data Cloud to power agents with CRM and other data. Other examples include Equinox and Wyndham Hotels, which are leveraging the platforms for real-time, personalized marketing and customer experiences across global markets.
The challenge for companies like Salesforce and others is to show how new agentic workflows actually differ from past forms of automation. The old model was driven by bots and deterministic rule-based systems merely pre-wired to take specific actions, said Rahul Auradkar, Salesforce’s GM and EVP of Unified Data Services.
“The new world of AI is rewriting those rules, and the re-writing of those rules is determined at the moment based on the information you have provided and you’ve grounded it with,” Auradkar told Digiday.
A key factor for Salesforce’s agentic strategy is its cloud and agent architecture. Auradkar said customers can buil

Earthly Lunar: Monitoring for the SDLC
Finally
Last year, our team spent a lot of time interviewing fellow Platform, DevOps, DevEx, CI/CD, and SRE engineers, as well as engineering leaders, in order to better understand their day-to-day challenges. We began this effort to see how
Earthfiles
, one of our products, could serve engineering teams at scale. But as we spoke to more and more people, we realized that platform engineering as an industry is on a collision course with something far more painful and visceral than just
build speed
.
It was the summer of 2024, and we needed to turn open-source success into commercial success for Earthfiles. Eleven thousand GitHub stars. How hard could it be to monetize that traction?
To make venture-scale money, we needed to go up-market and figure out what makes mid-size companies and enterprises tick and how our product might be able to help them. So we started interviewing platform and engineering leaders across the industry. DocuSign, Affirm, Roblox, Palo Alto Networks, Twilio, LinkedIn, Box, Morgan Stanley, BNY, and many more. We spoke to over 100 of these.
We started with a simple question:
What are the top issues that you’re struggling with in your day-to-day work?
We were hoping to get validation that developer productivity is a top concern and then be able to further narrow down how CI/CD speed would be able to unlock developer efficiency. But of all these interviews, only one mentioned build speed as a top issue, and it was largely biased by a recent production incident where they couldn’t get the fix out quickly enough due to a slow end-to-end CI/CD process.
In fact, the top issues they typically mentioned had nothing to do with productivity - not on the surface, anyway. It had to do more with how to best manage the engineering chaos that becomes inevitable at scale. You see, in the era of containers and microservices, there has been a general trend for companies to give more and more freedom to individual dev teams. It’s a container - if it slots in nicely in production, there’s less of a concern about what’s
inside
the container.

Pierluigi Paganini
April 22, 2025
SK Telecom warned that threat actors accessed customer Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) info through a malware attack.
SK Telecom is South Korea’s largest wireless telecom company, a major player in the country’s mobile and tech landscape.
It holds about 48% of the market share for mobile services, meaning around 34 million subscribers use its network. The company offers cellular service, along with 5G development, AI services, IoT solutions, cloud computing, and smart city infrastructure.
The carrier is part of the larger SK Group, which is one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates (also active in energy, semiconductors, chemicals, and more).
SK Telecom reported threat actors gained access to USIM-related information for customers following a malware attack. The Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) is a smart card used in mobile devices, it securely stores subscriber information, including the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and cryptographic keys.
The telecom giant detected an infection of its systems at 11 PM on Saturday, April 19, 2025. Upon discovering the infection, the company promptly reported it to the Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA) on Sunday, April 20, sanitized the impacted systems, and isolated the suspected hacking device. No cases of misuse of the information have been confirmed to date.
SK Telecom announced it had enhanced defensive measures and blocked illegal SIM card changes and abnormal authentication attempts.
The company is also offering impacted customers a subscription to the ‘SIM protection service’ for free.
“On April 19, 2025, at approximately 11:00 PM, SK Telecom discovered circumstances in which some SIM-related information of SK Telecom customers was suspected to have been leaked due to malware.” reads the
data breach notification
published by the company. “SK Telecom immediately deleted the malware after recognizing the possibility of a leak and isolated the suspected hacking device. As of now, there have been no confirmed cases of actual exploitation of the information, but we are implementing the following measures to prevent damage to our customers.”
The company is still investigating the security breach to determine the exact cause, the scale of the incident, and determine the leaked data. The South Korean provider also reported the data leak to the Personal Information Protection Commission at 10:00 a.m. on Tuesday, April 22.

When it comes to dial design, Grand Seiko is perhaps the most revered name in the watch industry. With models inspired by the seasons, its nation’s cultural history, and the milieu of its two main studios, the Japanese watchmaker has plenty of models for the discerning buyer. Yet, one dial design in particular remains its most iconic (as well as our personal favorite): the “Snowflake”, presented here as the
Spring Drive SBGA211
.

Debuting in 2005 in Japan (globally in 2010), the “Snowflake” dial isn’t merely a blanket of snow-inspired white but the result of an innovative, multi-step process. An accumulation of over 80 separate steps, the dial process begins with stamping a brass plate with a textured pattern and leads to a special brushing technique, silver plating, coating, and eventually the finishing touches, all evoking the look of freshly fallen snow. For the SBGA211, it’s displayed inside a 41mm case made of high-intensity titanium, which is not only known for its high scratch and corrosion resistance but also for being 30% lighter than stainless steel.

Of course, if you think beauty is only skin deep, Grand Seiko’s Spring Drive movement is here to prove you wrong. Inside the wintery watch is this hybrid wonder, blending the best of both mechanical and quartz calibers. Basically, the mainspring of a traditional mechanical movement gets wound, thus powering the hands as it
un
winds. However, for the Spring Drive — which is the result of over two decades of R&D — the accuracy of the mainspring is managed by an electromagnetic speed-regulating unit. Displayed through the exhibition caseback, the Caliber 9R65 Spring Drive creates a smooth gliding seconds hand and also boasts a 72-hour power reserve, tracked on a dial-side indicator.

Available now from Grand Seiko’s website, the Spring Drive SBGA211 “Snowflake” is priced at $6,600.

Proofpoint Debuts Unified Data Security Protection Across Data Exfiltration, Exposure and Insider Threats
Proofpoint, Inc
. announced the
launch of the industry's first unified data security solution designed
to simplify one of the most complex and fragmented challenges
organizations face: locating their data, classifying it correctly,
controlling who can access it, and monitoring how people interact with
it across all channels, from endpoints and email to the web and the
cloud.
Organizations
 today face escalating data security risks driven by uncontrolled data
sprawl across cloud apps, collaboration tools, endpoints, and AI
services-often beyond the visibility of security teams. The vendor
landscape has only intensified this challenge, offering fragmented,
single-channel data loss prevention and other point solutions that
prevent security teams from gaining a complete view of their data
exposure. The rapid adoption of generative AI compounds the problem, as
employees increasingly interact with sensitive data in unpredictable
ways. Proofpoint's
2024 Data Loss Landscape Report
reveals that 85% of organizations experienced a data loss incident last year, and over a quarter of enterprises don't know where their sensitive data resides.
Proofpoint's
 new unified data security approach addresses these challenges head-on
by combining data loss prevention (DLP), data security posture
management (DSPM), and insider threat management into a single, unified
architecture. Built on
Proofpoint Nexus
-
 which combines AI models, behavioral analytics, and human risk
intelligence across every control point - and new AI agents, this
solution enables organizations to locate their sensitive data,
understand its nature, govern access, prevent most data loss, and
monitor any risky actions that cannot be prevented.
"Securing
 data is fundamentally a human problem, amplified by growing data sprawl
 and increasing complexity," said Mayank Choudhary, executive vice
president and general manager, Data Security Group at Proofpoint. "With
today's announcement, we are redefining how organizations approach data
security. Our unified platform converges DLP, DSPM, and insider threat
management to eliminate the patchwork of point solutions that fail to
meet the demands of today's AI-first, data-centric world. It is
adaptive, intelligent, and prepared for an agentic AI future."
Data Security Transformed: Intelligent, Agent-Driven, and Adaptive
Like
 many other cybersecurity challenges, data security is conceptually
simple but has proven very difficult to implement at scale. If security
teams had unlimited resources and time, they could easily classify every
 document and data store, ensure that only the right people and accounts
 had access to it, and monitor alerts on anything that looked unusual.
In the real world, however, few teams have the resources they would like
 to apply to protecting their data.

Descope launches Agentic Identity Hub to simplify authentication for AI agents and workflows
by
Duncan Riley
SHARE
Authentication and user management platform company
Descope Inc.
today announced the launch of Agentic Identity Hub, a platform that helps organizations solve authentication and authorization challenges for artificial intelligence agents, systems and workflows.
The new platform includes the ability to provide apps with an easy way to become agent-ready while requiring user consent. That provides agents a scalable way to connect with more than 50 third-party tools and enterprise systems. In turn, that helps developers using
model context protocol
— Anthropic PBC’s open-source standard for connecting AI assistants to the systems where data lives — protect their MCP servers with purpose-built authorization application programming interfaces and software development kits.
The platform seeks to address the issue wherein agents, large language models and other AI systems have become increasingly embedded into enterprise and consumer workflows. As a result, developers are struggling to securely connect AI systems to external software-as-a-service tools and ensure that their own apps properly authenticate AI agents with the right level of access and human oversight.
Descope argues that as the industry converges on a few key standards to power identity infrastructure for agentic builds, such as 0Auth and MCP, developers face the choice between spending time to become experts in these protocols to build and manage authentication for AI systems, or risking identity spoofing, tool misuse, privilege compromise and other threats.
The new Agentic Identity Hub addresses these issues with capabilities that include support for inbound apps, providing every application an easy way to become its own identity provider using the OAuth standard. Doing so allows AI agents to authenticate, access authorized user data and take scoped actions securely on behalf of users with their explicit consent.
For outbound apps, the platform provides AI agent builders a secure, scalable way to connect AI agents to external tools without having to manually manage and store tokens, scopes and permissions. Developers have a choice of more than 50 out-of-the-box tool integration templates, including support for Gmail, HubSpot Inc., GitHub Inc., Snowflake Inc., Slack Technologies Inc., Notion Labs Inc. and Shopify Inc.
The new platform also provides support for MCP Auth software development kits and APIs to help developers build and manage remote MCP servers to secure their systems with robust authorization controls, as well as extend the MCP servers’ functionality by connecting them with multiple OAuth-based services.
“As AI systems make our lives easier, we must ensure the lives of developers building AI don’t become harder,” said co-founder and Chief Executive Slavik Markovich. “The Agentic Identity Hub provides a set of tools to help de

Abilene, Texas, shut down systems after a cyberattack caused server issues. The incident occurred on April 18, 2025, emergency services remained operational, and no financial irregularities were found.
“On April 18, 2025, City officials received reports of unresponsive servers within our internal network and immediately began executing our incident response plan and disconnecting affected and critical assets to secure our systems.” reads the
notice
of security incident published by the company. “We also launched an investigation and engaged industry-leading cybersecurity experts to determine the nature and scope of the incident and notified relevant authorities.”
The IT department worked tirelessly to restore services, however, some of the impacted systems remain offline as a precaution, but emergency services continue. The experts who are investigating the incident are not aware of financial irregularities following the event.
Card systems at government offices are down, so only cash, checks, or online card payments are accepted. The city announced that it won’t shut off utilities for late payments.
“Water utilities customers are still able to pay their Municipal Services Statements. While systems and telephones are being brought back online, you may experience a slower than normal response to service requests.  We are reviewing email requests and will respond as quickly as possible.” continues the notice. “Due to system issues, we will not shut off past-due accounts. “
The IT team continues to monitor for unusual activity, City officials shared emergency contacts and announced that the full recovery will take time.
In May 2023, the IT systems at the City of Dallas, Texas,
were targeted
by a ransomware attack. To prevent the threat from spreading within the network, the City has shut down the impacted IT systems.
The City confirmed the security incident and worked to recover from the ransomware attack that impacted its services, including the police department.
The
Royal ransomware
group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Other government organizations have suffered ransomware attacks in the past, including
Dallas County
and
Wichita County

April 22, 2025
Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) warns of hundreds of millions in unauthorized trades linked to hacked brokerage accounts.
Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) reported that the damage caused by unauthorized access to and transactions on internet trading services is increasing.
“There has been a sharp increase in the number of cases of unauthorized access and unauthorized trading (trading by third parties) on Internet trading services using stolen customer information (login IDs, passwords, etc.) from fake websites (phishing sites) disguised as websites of real securities companies.” reads the
FSA’s alert
.
FSA warns that cases of unauthorized trading via stolen login data from phishing sites mimicking real securities firms are sharply increasing on online trading platforms.
Below are some data provided by the agency that reflect only currently known cases of unauthorized access and fraudulent trading, however, more undiscovered incidents may exist.

Typically, attackers hijack victim accounts, sell held stocks, and use the proceeds to buy assets like Chinese stocks, which remain in the account post-attack. Reported sales and purchase amounts represent total transaction volumes, not customer losses.
To avoid falling victim to unauthorized trading caused by stolen login credentials, users should follow key precautions: never click links in emails or SMS, always access brokerage sites via pre-saved bookmarks, and enable security features like multi-factor authentication and login notifications. Avoid password reuse, choose complex passwords, and check account activity often. If you suspect fraud, change passwords and contact your brokerage immediately. Keeping devices updated and using reliable antivirus software also helps prevent malware-related data theft.
Japan ’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) recommends checking the
warning
issued by the Japan Securities Dealers Association regarding matters to be aware of when using securities companies’ online trading services.

Typically, attackers hijack victim accounts, sell held stocks, and use the proceeds to buy assets like Chinese stocks, which remain in the account post-attack. Reported sales and purchase amounts represent total transaction volumes, not customer losses.
To avoid falling victim to unauthorized trading caused by stolen login credentials, users should follow key precautions: never click links in emails or SMS, always access brokerage sites via pre-saved bookmarks, and enable security features like multi-factor authentication and login notifications. Avoid password reuse, choose complex passwords, and check account activity often. If you suspect fraud, change passwords and contact your brokerage immediately. Keeping devices updated and using reliable antivirus software also helps prevent malware-related data theft.

Two deals stood out during the Q1 wave of consolidation in the ad tech and martech landscape, with activity from agency holding companies piquing interest: Publicis Groupe bought Lotame, while WPP acquired InfoSum.
These deals were notable as they represented holding companies writing big checks for ad tech or martech assets — let’s put the pending InterPublic Group (
read Acxiom
) merger with Omnicom to one side for now — rare occurrences in recent years, compared to similar M&A in the 2010s.

In both cases, the Madison Avenue stalwarts bought close bedfellows (see below), in quick succession. As one source, who requested anonymity as they were not cleared to speak with the press, said, “You usually see holdcos [sic] copy holdcos with acquisitions.”

in Europe and APAC, plus it enhances the holdco’s ID graph by 1.6 billion
The relationship between WPP and InfoSum’s exec teams

Despite Digiday’s inquiries, the official transaction amounts were not publicly disclosed. However, separate sources independently claimed both transactions represented exit amounts considerably below their respective earlier valuations. The source, who has extensive experience working for holding company agencies, told Digiday the successive purchases represented “another four to five years of the narrative they just bought.”
Meanwhile, several sources went on to elaborate how the deals represent the evolution of data clean rooms — itself a loose term to characterize platforms that enable the sharing of sensitive first-party data — which have to evolve beyond their first iterations as scaling such propositions becomes challenging.

April 21, 2025
Researchers spotted a new North Korea-linked group Kimsuky ‘s campaign, exploiting a patched Microsoft Remote Desktop Services flaw to gain initial access.
While investigating a security breach, the AhnLab SEcurity intelligence Center (ASEC) researchers discovered a North Korea-linked group
Kimsuky
‘s campaign, tracked as Larva-24005. Attackers exploited an RDP vulnerability to gain initial access to the target systems.
“In some systems, initial access was gained through exploiting the RDP vulnerability (BlueKeep, CVE-2019-0708). While an RDP vulnerability scanner was found in the compromised system, there is no evidence of its actual use.” reads the
report
published by ASEC. “The threat actor also used other means to distribute the malware, such as attaching the same file to emails and exploiting the Microsoft Office Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882)
[1]
.”
Once they gained access to the systems, the threat actors modified the configuration by installing MySpy malware and RDPWrap to maintain remote access.
In the final stage, the attackers deployed KimaLogger or RandomQuery keyloggers to record keystrokes. Experts observed Kimsuky sending phishing emails targeting Korea and Japan from compromised systems.
Since September 2023, the North Korean APT has targeted organizations in South Korea, the U.S., China, Japan, Germany, Singapore, and several other countries. Their activity includes phishing campaigns against South Korea and Japan and attacks on South Korea’s software, energy, and financial sectors starting in October 2023.
ASEC researchers also published indicators of compromise (IoC) for this campaign.
Kimsuky cyberespionage group
(aka ARCHIPELAGO, Black Banshee,

) was first
spotted
by Kaspersky researchers in 2013. The group works under the control of the Reconnaissance General Bureau (RGB) foreign intelligence service. At the end of October 2020, the
US-CERT published a report on Kimusky’s recent activities
that provided information on their TTPs and infrastructure.
The APT group mainly targets think tanks and organizations in South Korea, other victims were in the United States, Europe, and Russia.
In February, ASEC researchers observed North Korea’s
Kimsuky
APT group conducting spear-phishing attacks to deliver forceCopy info-stealer malware.
The state-sponsored hackers sent spear-phishing messages to distribute malicious *.LNK shortcut files, disguised as Office documents. When opened, they execute PowerShell or Mshta to download malware like
PebbleDash
and RDP Wrapper, to control the infected systems.
The attackers use a custom-built
RDP Wrapper
to enable remote desktop access, likely modifying export functions to evade detection.
